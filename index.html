<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Collected Stories (Sun &amp; Moon Classics)</h2><p>Distinguished Djuna Barnes biographer Phillip Herring (Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes [Viking]) has here gathered all the short stories of Djuna Barnes, including several that have never been published previously.<br>Beginning in 1914, Djuna Barnes contributed regularly to numerous magazines and newspapers works of fiction, poetry, essay, and drama. Unlike some works in other genres in which she wrote, Barnes held her stories in particularly high regard, revising several of the stories collected in A Book (1923; reprinted as A Night Among the Horses in 1929) late in her life. These stories from Spillway, her other early tales, and other stories never before published are collected in this volume. What they reveal is the breadth and consistency of Barnes's story writing, and should help establish her as one of the most interesting and vital storytellers of the great period of American literary output after World War I.<br>Barnes is recognized internationally for her masterwork Nightwood and for other works of fiction, including Ryder and Ladies Almanack. She also wrote plays, most notably The Antiphon - which will he republished by Sun &amp; Moon Press next year - and shorter works collected in At the Roots of the Stars: The Short Plays. Her early poetic work, The Book of Repulsive Women, has increasingly gained readers over the past few years. A selection of her drawings, which often accompanied her literary writing, has just been published by Sun &amp; Moon Press as Poe's Mother.</p><p>Djuna Barnes, best known for her 1936 novel <i>Nightwood</i>, was a modernist with a fertile talent, who worked as an illustrator, a reporter, and a feature writer for newspapers and avant-garde magazines in the first half of this century. In their playfulness with words and syntax, the short stories in this volume, written between 1914 and 1942 and collected by her biographer, Phillip Herring, show the influence of James Joyce and Gertrude Stein. Many were written for magazines and end with a plot twist. As one might expect from a visual artist, these stories are full of symbolic images, often hauntingly grotesque.Barnes biographer Philip Herring introduces this comprehensive collection--every tale known to have been written by Barnes--which will be of great interest to scholars and devotees. Others, however, might be confused by the inadequately annotated gathering, since the 41 stories are not dated, nor are the original places of publication noted. Most of the early fiction (written for weekly magazines) is identifiable by its melodramatic naturalism: slangy stories of urban romance that emphasize class distinctions and the harsher realities of city life, featuring bohemians in Greenwich Village, dance-hall girls, and immigrant workers. Then, after roughly a hundred pages, the high priestess of modernism emerges in dark lyrical tales of disaffection and alienation. With their cosmopolitan settings and points of view, Barnes's mature work displays all the ambiguity, world weariness, and cynicism that distinguish Nightwood (1936), her dense, elusive modern masterpiece. There are several stories about dying aristocrats, beset by age, indifferent to their past. ``The Terrorists'' is a scathing view of la vie boh&#x201a;mienne (cafe revolutionaries preach destruction while indulging their appetite for the good life), and the particular horrors of modern life are on view in stories like ``Oscar,'' with its intimations of incest, madness, and murder. Mismatched lovers are common in Barnes's work: older women entertain young men in hopes of staving off decay; a mother falls in love with her daughter's suitor; a doctor's wife randomly beds a salesman to debase herself; a wealthy woman wants to marry her footman; and two coquettish sisters tantalize Parisian gentlemen. At the center of many of these mordant tales are relations that lead to spiritual death, if not actual destruction. ``Dusie,'' a portrait of bohemian lesbians in Paris, recalls the pervasive smolder of decay and decadence in Nightwood. The best were already available in other collections, but it's always worthwhile to see an author complete. Unfortunately, you'll need a bibliography to locate many of these pieces in Barnes's unusual career. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It provides answers to many questions raised by the presentation of the hymns themselves, and it offers background information on all its hymn texts and tunes. Information about hymnists and composers which can be useful in teaching and preaching is also to be found....For those who do not actually use the Lutheran Book of Worship in services, the Companion offers the most comprehensive introduction to the various traditions of Lutheran hymnody presently available in English. The initial sections deal not only with the familiar Anglo-American tradition and the classic German hymns; they also lead the reader into the lesser known Scandinavian and Central European traditions. In so doing this Companion makes its unique contribution to hymnological literature. The hymnologist and musician will, of course, find the complete set of indexes of special interest and value....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Diagnostic Imaging: Interventional Procedures</h2><p><p>More than 100 interventional procedures, lavishly illustrated with <b>800+ outstanding medical images</b>, highlight the second edition of this practical reference.

As a signal achievement of that legacy, in 2008, Americans elected their first African American president. Some would argue that we have finally arrived at a postracial America, but <i>The Imperative of Integration</i> indicates otherwise. Elizabeth Anderson demonstrates that, despite progress toward racial equality, African Americans remain disadvantaged on virtually all measures of well-being. Segregation remains a key cause of these problems, and Anderson skillfully shows why racial integration is needed to address these issues. Weaving together extensive social science findings--in economics, sociology, and psychology--with political theory, this book provides a compelling argument for reviving the ideal of racial integration to overcome injustice and inequality, and to build a better democracy.</p><br><p> Considering the effects of segregation and integration across multiple social arenas, Anderson exposes the deficiencies of racial views on both the right and the left. She reveals the limitations of conservative explanations for black disadvantage in terms of cultural pathology within the black community and explains why color blindness is morally misguided. Multicultural celebrations of group differences are also not enough to solve our racial problems. Anderson provides a distinctive rationale for affirmative action as a tool for promoting integration, and explores how integration can be practiced beyond affirmative action.</p><br><p> Offering an expansive model for practicing political philosophy in close collaboration with the social sciences, this book is a trenchant examination of how racial integration can lead to a more robust and responsive democracy.</p></p><p><p>"This book is beautifully and clearly argued at the highest philosophical level and, at the same time, attentive to social and historical realities. It offers a compelling vision of an ideal of integration that has largely been lost to view. Whether or not you agree with her, Elizabeth Anderson has staked out a position that all serious thinking about American race relations must now contend with."<b>--Kwame Anthony Appiah, author of <i>The Ethics of Identity</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Imperative of Integration</i> accomplishes two important things: It demonstrates--using rigorous social scientific analysis--that racial segregation is the root cause of the continuing social disadvantage of African Americans. And it argues persuasively--using subtle philosophical reasoning--that in light of American history, a concerted effort to integrate our schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces is the only path forward consistent with a commitment to social justice. Serious students of contemporary American society will want to read this book."<b>--Glenn Loury, Brown University</b></p><p>"In <i>The Imperative of Integration</i>, Elizabeth Anderson expertly blends social science research, moral philosophy, and political theory to make a lucid, compelling, and impassioned case for the desegregation of American society. Decades after the passage of landmark civil rights legislation, American neighborhoods and schools remain highly segregated by race. This clear moral statement of the urgent need for integration is long overdue and should be read carefully by all Americans."<b>--Douglas S. Massey, coauthor of <i>American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Imperative of Integration</i> is an unusually rich, multidimensional, and multileveled book that raises the bar dramatically for any future work on racial justice. Scholars in a wide range of fields will profit from this book's lucid narrative and argument, as well as its impressive interdisciplinary scope."<b>--Charles W. Mills, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"There is no other comprehensive defense of racial integration remotely like this one in terms of scope, erudition, clarity, and moral sophistication. The discussions of discrimination, stereotyping, and stigma are the best I have seen anywhere, and the book pulls data from an amazing range of social science disciplines--political science, sociology, social psychology, and economics. This book is truly exceptional."<b>--Lawrence Blum, University of Massachusetts, Boston</b></p><b>Elizabeth Anderson</b> is the John Rawls Collegiate Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Catullus's poetry is by turns ribald, lyric, romantic, satirical; sometimes obscene and always intelligent, it offers us vivid pictures of the poet's friends, enemies, and lovers. The verses to his friends are bitchy, funny, and affectionate; those to his enemies are often wonderfully nasty. Many poems brilliantly evoke his passionate affair with Lesbia, often identified as Clodia Metelli, a femme fatale ten years his senior and the smart, adulterous wife of an arrogant aristocrat. Cicero later claimed she poisoned her husband. <br><br>This new bilingual translation of Catullus's surviving poems by Peter Green is fresh, bawdy, and utterly engaging. Unlike its predecessors, it adheres to the principle that the rhythm of a poem, whether familiar or not, is among the most crucial elements for its full appreciation. Green provides an essay on the poet's life and literary background, a historical sketch of the politically fraught late Roman Republic in which Catullus lived, copious notes on the poems, a wide-ranging bibliography for further reading, and a full glossary.</p><p>"Peter Green is an outstanding translator. The reader&#x2019;s excited anticipation of pleasure and instruction on receiving a new translation of a Latin poet by Green is not disappointed. This is a labor of love which makes Catullus accessible to the Latinless reader and more familiar to those who can read Latin."&#x2015;Susan Treggiari, Stanford University<br><br>"For almost half a century Peter Green has been one of the finest of all modern translators of classical verse. His Catullus is well up to his usual form&#x2015;recapturing for a contemporary audience the wit, malice, erudition and erotic charm of the Latin original."&#x2015;Mary Beard, author of <i>The Parthenon</i><b>Peter Green</b> is Dougherty Centennial Professor Emeritus of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin and Adjunct Professor of Classics at the University of Iowa.

That is the logic behind the bestselling Purchasing Chessboard�, used by hundreds of corporations worldwide to reduce costs and increase value with suppliers. The 64 squares in the Purchasing Chessboard provide a rich reservoir of methods that can be applied either individually or combined. And because many of these methods are not customarily used by procurement, the Purchasing Chessboard is also the perfect tool for helping buyers to think and act outside the box and find new solutions. A well-proven concept that works across all industries and all categories in any given situation, it is little wonder that business leaders and procurement professionals alike are excited by, and enjoy strategizing around, the Purchasing Chessboard.</p><p><br>This second edition of The Purchasing Chessboard addresses the new realities of a highly volatile economic environment and describes the many&#x2015;sometimes surprising&#x2015;ways in which the Purchasing Chessboard is being used in today's business world.

Classically educated in the West, Aurobindo spent the early part of his career campaigning for India's independence and later became one of the most revered figures of Eastern spirituality.<br><br> A.S. Dalal is a clinical psychologist and a leading scholar of Aurobindo's work."Consciousness is a reality inherent in existence," taught the Hindu mystic Aurobindo (1872-1950). He rejected Western psychology, which begins with individual conscious personalities viewing and reacting to phenomena external to themselves. Human minds participate in a continuum of Mind, of which the practice of "Integral Yoga" can make one aware. On the other hand, Aurobindo stressed conscious reality's involvement in all things material, and rejected claims that the material world is mere illusion. This dynamic Reality, which transcends we who are individual instances of it, this "greater psychology," is the topic of this systematically arranged anthology drawn from the 30 volumes of Aurobindo's writings. Dalal (Hidden Forces of Life, Growing Within), a clinical psychologist connected with Aurobindo's ashram, supplements the anthology with seven essays on the teacher's psychological thought and a useful, concise glossary. While Aurobindo's more popular texts (The Life Divine, Letters on Yoga) are widely available, this anthology offers a clearly organized introduction to his views and their relation to yoga practice. It offers a profound antidote to the individualistic psychology of the West.DSteve Young, Montclair State Univ., NJ <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Greed (BFI Film Classics)</h2><p><i>Greed </i>was to have been Erich von Stroheim's masterwork, but his immense plans were his undoing.

It is the little<br> shadow which runs across<br> the grass and loses itself<br> in the sunset.<br><br> Crowfoot, Blackfoot<br> warrior and orator<br> chapter one<br><br> Voice, Instinct, and the Oral Tradition<br> a context for voice<br><br> Our voices carry a rich legacy. How we speak and listen today has emerged from the long unfolding story of human history. In her book The Four-Fold Way, cultural anthropologist and author Angeles Arrien suggests that indigenous wisdom and practices have an essential role to play in restoring our balance with each other and the earth. She discovered that voice&#x2014;as expressed in song, sound, breath, story, and even silence&#x2014;is a vital element in indigenous societies around the world. In many of these cultures, the voice is directly linked to the soul or spirit of a person.1<br><br> The oral tradition is an enormous area of study, as is language development in individuals and societies. I must, however, make brief mention of these subjects as a way to root this exploration of voice in a deeper appreciation for our individual and collective vocal heritage. Let&#x2019;s begin with your own vocal genesis.<br><br> You were paying attention to voices long before you were born. Your ability to hear was fully formed by the time you were a three-month-old fetus. You floated in a rich world of sound as well as in amniotic fluid. Your mother&#x2019;s voice and heartbeat were most familiar, but you also discerned the voices of family members and other muffled sounds from the outside world.<br><br> At the moment of your birth, your first act as a distinct individual was a vocal one: you cried. That sound marked the doorway between your prenatal and postnatal worlds and announced your arrival on earth in no uncertain terms. The sound of your brand-new voice making itself audible in the world for the first time was the initial step on a vocal adventure that continues today.<br><br> Next you used your voice to communicate your hunger, discomfort, and frustration with distinct cries. If the adults around you were paying attention, they learned to interpret them accurately and respond to what you needed. Within the first days of your life, you also got busy decoding and echoing the complex world of sound around you. You began interpreting vocal sounds, facial expressions, and gestures long before you understood the exact words being spoken. Within a matter of a few months, your ears, eyes, brain, mouth, lungs, tongue, teeth, and lips performed a monumental task&#x2014;transforming observations, random noises, coos, babbles, and squeals into your first words. Your voice was literally formed by &#x201c;reading&#x201d; the voices around you. Your ability to pay keen attention to vocal nuances and inflections is innately and fundamentally human.2<br><br> Your ancestors passed these skills along to you. You are a direct descendant of good communicators. Being able to read voices accurately was a fundamental part of our human evolution. Those who got it wrong didn&#x2019;t survive long enough to pass along their DNA. Spoken language is a relatively new invention&#x2014;approximately 100,000 years old. No one can be sure how language actually emerged, but it most certainly was preceded by some system of expressive vocalization. Through eons of time our voices, ears, and brains coevolved increasingly complex linguistic systems for conveying information, establishing dominance, forging affection, organizing projects, and solving problems. Our deep heritage as oral communicators is still active in how we relate to each other today, whether or not we are consciously aware of it.<br><br> Most of us in the modern world live in cultures so immersed in the written word that it&#x2019;s hard for us to imagine how vitally important the voice is in an oral tradition culture. Long before the written word emerged, the collective memory of a people was kept alive through time primarily through the power of voice. Each subsequent generation was responsible for carrying on the legends, mythology, history, genealogy, and social mores that defined a particular culture. This vast and detailed body of information had to be assimilated through a lengthy process of deep listening, vocal repetition, and correction that took many painstaking years to perfect. In the oral tradition, words and sounds carry powerful magic that can bring the rains, appease the gods, invoke healing, access mysterious realms, call the animals in for a hunt, and communicate with the ancestors.<br><br> When I heard West African wisdom teacher Malidoma Som� speak several years ago, he offered his firsthand experience in the contrast between oral and written cultures. Som� has earned multiple advanced degrees from prestigious universities in both Europe and the United States. As a young adult, he also went through a traditional initiation rite under the guidance of the elders in his village. Whenever Som� returned to his home village in Burkina Faso, he was struck by his &#x201c;uneducated&#x201d; brother&#x2019;s ability to recite hour upon hour of story, song, and ritual from memory. Som� suggested that the increased reliance on the written word has radically diminished our ability to retain and recall large amounts of information3&#x2014;a skill your ancestors probably took for granted wherever they came from.<br><br> One of the oldest cultures on earth&#x2014;the Australian aboriginal people&#x2014;offers another vivid example of how powerful the voice is in an oral tradition culture. Aboriginal people believe that their ancestors literally sang the world into being. Their song leaders memorized long and complex songs&#x2014;the &#x201c;songlines&#x201d;&#x2014;that passed in an unbroken line from generation to generation for 40,000 years. They relied on these songlines for many things in their society. Travelers who knew these songs were able to literally sing their way safely through the vast outback by following the songlines. Embedded in the songlines was the physical geography of the land, including sources of food and water. The songlines also related the spiritual stories and sacred sites reflected in each place.4 From a Western perspective it is difficult to comprehend just how essential these songs&#x2014;and the voices in which they were sung&#x2014;were to the spiritual, social, and physical survival of the people over such a long period of time.<br><br> I recently saw an example of how the oral tradition might have been expressed in England during the Middle Ages. Actor Benjamin Bagby is featured in a film where he performs the epic saga Beowulf in Middle English while accompanying himself on an Anglo-Saxon harp.5<br><br> Without the benefit of stage sets, other actors, dramatic lighting, or other theatrical conventions, the actor painted the terror and triumph of the tale through the power of his voice, facial expressions, and gestures alone. Witnessing this astounding performance reconnected me to the oral tradition that thrived in indigenous Europe for centuries. Many of these sagas, legends, and mythologies have been captured and preserved in written form. Nowadays you can find them in abundance at any bookstore or library and silently read them at your leisure. Imagine, though, what it would have been like to hear them from a powerful traveling storyteller who arrived in your small, isolated village once a year. Can you feel the wonder, terror, and excitement of being awash in fantastic tales dramatically spoken and sung into the breathless silence around the community hearth? Can you sense how profoundly those tales would impact you in the absence of books, television, radio, film, and the Internet?<br><br> Though the oral tradition cultures have been seriously diminished by modern life, remnants still survive in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.<br><br> In many of the world&#x2019;s religious and spiritual traditions, the spoken word is still a source of great power. All of the sacred texts from the world&#x2019;s major religions were passed along through the oral tradition long before they were written down. These texts are still memorized and recited from generation to generation, usually with precise vocal inflections and nuances. Creation stories frequently begin with the divine speaking or singing the world into existence. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, God says, &#x201c;Let there be light,&#x201d; and light appears. In the Christian New Testament, the gospel of John begins, &#x201c;In the beginning was the Word.&#x201d; Prayers are repeated in the exact same way for centuries. Mantras are chanted to invoke powerful deities and access deep meditation. Jews recite the many names of the divine, and Muslims answer the call to prayer five times a day. Sacred words and songs are employed to declare intentions, offer blessings, and mark transitions. At any given moment throughout human history, this world has been wrapped in the sacred sounds of many peoples.<br><br> By contrast, we live our modern lives in a barrage of trivial language. Open your ears in any public place and you&#x2019;re likely to hear yammering televisions, public service announcements, droning background music, and the incessant blabbering of people on their cell phones. Our voices grow louder in order to penetrate the din and drone of machines all around us. In a given week, we say more words to more people in more ways than our ancestors could ever imagine. Talk has become very cheap indeed, and our words, though plentiful, are often flimsy in meaning and inflection.<br><br> Cultivating vocal presence helps you reclaim the powerful legacy of the oral tradition in your life. As you rediscover the color and subtlety in your voice, it becomes a vehicle for your eloquence to enter the world. You take your place at the end of a long line of ancestors who sang their songs, spoke their stories, struggled to stay alive, and prevailed so you could add your voice to the chorus of humanity.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s shift our attention from the lessons of our collective vocal heritage to the ways your voice is connected to your identity.</p><h2>Certified Nurse Educator (CNE) Review Manual, Third Edition</h2><p><p>The third edition of this classic study guide for nurse educators taking the CNE exam continues to be the only concise review book to feature a systematic approach to exam preparation.

Within these pages are representations of Nubians in ancient art, the great tradition of Western masters such as Manet and Picasso, and contemporary work by lesser known artists of color. <br>Assembled chronologically, these essays draw upon multiculturalism, postcolonialism, and critical race theory to confront the longstanding tradition of art as a means of looking at "the other." The essays address important questions about racial visibility and racial politics, asking whether modern concepts of race can be imposed upon ancient art, whether there is a link between pictorial realism and Orientalism, and how today's artists and critics can engage our visual culture's inherent racialized dimension. <br>Richly illustrated, this pioneering volume lays the groundwork for a better understanding of the complex and shifting category of race and its significance in our visual culture and everyday lives. Unmatched in historical scope and presentation, "Race-ing Art History" will be the essential guide to the opportunities and challenges involved in integrating race into the study of art.

The synergy of global transformations has now brought to an end Korea&#39;s proverbial identity and role as the helpless shrimp among whales, and both North Korea and South Korea have taken on new roles in the process of redefining and projecting their national identities. Synthetic national identity theory offers a useful perspective on change and continuity in Korea&#39;s turbulent relationships with the great powers over the years. Following a review of Korean diplomatic history and competing theoretical approaches, along with a synthetic national-identity theory as an alternative approach, one chapter each is devoted to how Korea relates to the four powers in turn, and the book concludes with a consideration of inter-Korean relations and potential reunification.</p><p>Emphasizing the most recent developments in East Asia, including the ongoing confrontation with North Korea over its nuclear program, this book examines how North and South Korea have emerged separately and in relation to one another in the post-Cold War world."Kim has produced a work that is a must for undergraduate and graduate collections on Asia...Essential." -- Choice<br><br>"Kim's analysis is stimulating...well-worth reading...A valuable work of scholarship that will appeal to both Koreanists and non-specialists alike." <br>Timothy C.

As geographer Larry R. Ford argues, architectural histories and guidebooks tell us surprisingly little about the character of American cities because they concentrate on buildings taken out of context, buildings divorced from space. In <i>The Spaces between Buildings</i>, Ford focuses on the neglected "nooks and crannies" between structures, supplementing his analysis with three photographic essays.</p><p>Long before Ford knew anything about geography or architecture, he was a connoisseur of front porches, alleys, and loading docks. As a kid in Columbus, Ohio, he knew where to find coal chutes to play in, which rooftops and fire escapes were ideally suited for watching parades, and which stoops were perfect for waiting for a bus. To him the spaces between buildings seemed wonderfully integrated and connected. <i>The Spaces between Buildings</i> is the result of Ford's preoccupation with the relationship of buildings to one another and how their means of access and boundaries organize the areas around us.</p><p> As Ford observes, a city with friendly, permeable facades and a great variety of street-level doors is more conducive to civic life than a city characterized by fortresslike structures with blank walls and invisible doors. Life on the street is defined and guided by the nature of the surrounding buildings. Similarly, a residential neighborhood with front porches, small lawns or gardens, and houses with lots of windows and architectural details presents a more walkable and gregarious setting than a neighborhood where public space is surrounded by walls, three-car garage doors, blank facades, and concrete driveways.</p><p>Ford begins by looking at the growth of four urban places, each representing a historical era as much as a geographic location: the Islamic medina; the city shaped by the Spanish renaissance; the nineteenth-century North American city; and the twentieth-century American city. His first essay also discusses the evolution of the free-standing structure as a basic urban building type and the problems encountered in beautifying the often work-a-day back and side yards that have helped to create the image of the untidy American city. The second essay examines the urban trend toward viewing lawns, gardens, hedges, and trees as an essential adjunct to architecture. The final essay focuses on pedestrian and vehicular spaces. Here the author includes the landscape of the garage, sidewalks, streets, and alleys.</p><p>In its exploration of how spaces become places, <i>The Spaces between Buildings</i> invites readers to see anew the spaces they encounter every day and often take for granted.</p></p><p><p><b>Larry R. Ford </b> is Professor in the Department of Geography at San Diego State University. </p><p>"The lively work of a geographer who has spent years exploring cities... His explorations range across a broad spectrum, from the form and character of building skins to the effects of zoning and building codes on urban design. There is similar breadth to the temporal sweep of his work, which focuses primarily on contemporary American cities but is comfortable reaching back to nineteenth-century or earlier antecedents to explain contemporary urban forms and patterns... [Ford] addresses and integrates an enormous range of issues of contemporary urban form that lie under our noses but to which, all too often, we find it beneath our dignity to pay attention. Ford pays attention. In one cogent comment after another, he reminds us of the importance of examining and thinking about our daily living and working environments."</p> (Iain Robertson <i>Landscape Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The clarity and scope of Ford's survey make the book engaging and informative not only for planners and designers, but also for readers generally interested in the shape of our cities."</p> (Evelyn Soriano Ibarra <i>Urban Ecology</i>)<br><br><p>"Easily accessible and useful to anyone interested in the pattern of our cities."</p> (Dick Farley <i>Bloomsbury Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Through description and photography, Ford offers a guide to the qualities of design, architecture, and ornamentation that create the character of urban spaces.

Perhaps then the spaces where most individuals spend most of their time would no longer be taken for granted.

Until educators come to grips with the full meaning of SEL--its strong theoretical basis, the tools available for applying this knowledge in classrooms, and the very real impacts it produces for students--we will continue to see a disconnect between public education and the needs of the students and society it serves.

They have served as voices in the wilderness, gathering evidence for and supporting programs that foster these fundamental skills.

In search of the truth about Alma and Alexander Zemlinsky, Antony Beaumont read them&#x2015;and found what he was looking for. But he found far more: the authentic saga of one of the century's most charismatic personalities. The Diaries depict in intimate detail the four years during which Alma grew from adolescence into womanhood. Opening with her first, heady affair with Gustav Klimt, they break off shortly before her marriage to Gustav Mahler. "To me," writes Beaumont, "reading The Diaries is like raising a curtain, behind which stands the Vienna of 1900 in all its majesty, and so close that one can almost reach out and touch it. The vitality of everyday life, eye-witness accounts of significant artistic events, unique insights into the behavioral patterns and linguistic conventions of homo austriacus&#x2015;all these serve to make the book unique."Having come to grips with Alma's handwriting, Beaumont and his coeditor for the German edition, Susanne Rode-Breymann, added meticulously researched commentaries and annotations. The German edition was published in the autumn of 1997.</p><p>Alma Mahler was born in Vienna in 1879. As the daughter of the landscape painter Emile Schindler, she was afforded easy entrance into the cultural life of the city; it seems that by the time these diaries open there was no part of the artistic, musical, literary, and theatrical life in fin-de-si�cle Vienna with which Alma was not intimately connected. Before marrying the composer Gustav Mahler in 1902, Alma had already been a pupil and lover of Zemlinsky, Klimt, and Burckhard. (And after Mahler died she married Walter Gropius, had an affair with Oskar Kokoschka, and then married Franz Werfel.) In combining the naivet� of a teenager on the cusp of womanhood with a wonderfully frank account of a remarkable time and place, Alma has left a priceless and unique record of personal and artistic history. The editor and translator Antony Beaumont rightly comments that reading the diaries is like "raising a curtain, behind which stands the Vienna of 1900 in all its majesty. So close that you can almost reach out and touch it". <i>--Nick Wroe</i>"The Viennese enchantress Alma Schindler (1879-1964) was one of our era's most fascinating and fabled women. . . .

The day-by-day account of where she went, who she met, and what she saw or listened to gives a good notion of daily life in Vienna at its peak."&#x2015;Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Alma flirted with several of Vienna's most brilliant artists, and her diaries, which conclude with her engagement, are as enjoyable for their savvy artistic observations as for their sometimes racy sexuality. Beaumont's selections reveal a young woman with an iron will (she pulled her own molar) who nevertheless craved a submissive role. If her genius husband brought Western music to the edge of modernism, Alma seems balanced on the brink of the modern age&#x2015;a combination of proto-feminist and femme fatale."&#x2015;The New Yorker<br><br>"The diaries have been translated with panache and appalled affection by Antony Beaumont. 'In places,' he writes in his introduction, 'one can almost picture Alma as a Bloomsbury debutante, but . . . she also like to assume more serious roles: the Catholic agnostic, the Nietzschean immoralist, the art critic, the femme fatale. I have done my best to vary the shades of purple accordingly.' The result is a portrait of Alma as an individual rather than an adjunct, an invaluable prelude to her well-documented career as a consort."&#x2015;Times Literary Supplement<br><br>"The most wonderful masterpiece of unconscious humour."&#x2015;The Spectator<br><br>"Partly a sober chronicle, partly a highly explosive journal intime . . . these jottings are far more than a mere biography."&#x2015;S�ddeutsche Zeitung<br><br>"Until now, even experts knew little more than her own, radically white-washed memoirs. . . .

His arrival and introduction to the local society sets the stage for an urbane and polished tale.<br><i>South Wind</i> brilliantly evokes the dreamy, languorous quality of life on Nepenthe, a town of whitewashed houses perched on sheer rock cliffs above a gleaming sea. While peasants clamber up roads of black volcanic lava to work in the vineyards, aristocrats while away the torpid midday hours on sun-dappled terraces, discoursing of life and love. The memorable cast of characters includes a host of expatriates, freethinkers, eccentrics, politicians, zealots, and all manner of ne'er-do-wells who mingle in the picturesque settlement's taverns, villas, and streets. By the time Bishop Heard is ready to leave Nepenthe, there has been a murder, a fearsome volcanic eruption, an art forgery, and other nefarious doings &#x2014; all recounted in eloquent descriptions, replete with provocative ideas, glittering epigrams, and mordant satire.</p><p>British author Norman Douglas (1868&#x2013;1952) traveled widely, and the books inspired by his rambles in Tunisia, Austria, and Italy are noted for their erudition and insights.

Its accessible and vivid prose makes clear the links between crime and politics in a period of gathering economic crisis.</p><p><b>Christian Parenti</b> is the author of <i>The Soft Cage</i> and <i>The Freedom</i>, and is currently writing a book on Afghanistan. He is a visiting fellow at the CUNY Graduate School&#x2019;s Center for Place, Culture and Politics, and his articles appear regularly in <i>The Nation.</i> He lives in New York City.In this important book, Parenti surveys the rise of the prison industrial complex from the Nixon through Reagan eras and into the present. Why does the United States currently have one of the highest rates of incarceration in the world, with over 1.8 million Americans living behind bars? Why are only 29 precent of all prisoners violent offenders? Parenti, a former radio journalist and now a professor at the New College of California, argues that capitalism implies and demands a certain amount of poverty; the powers that be then respond by incarcerating drug users, the underclass, and other relatively powerless persons. Parenti provides a very thorough account of this process as well as a realistic portrayal of an American prison life characterized by rape, torture, gangs, and prisoners as a source of labor.

It was probably created between 1120 and 1140 at St. Albans Abbey, located on the site where Alban, England&#x2019;s first saint, was martyred.<br><br>The manuscript&#x2019;s powerfully drawn figures and saturated colors are distinct from those in previous Anglo-Saxon painting and signal the arrival of the Romanesque style of illumination in England. Although most twelfth-century prayer books were not illustrated, the St. Albans Psalter includes more than 40 fullpage illuminations and over 200 historiated initials. Decorated with gold and precious colors, the psalter offers a display unparalleled by any other English manuscript to survive from the period.<br><br>In 2007 the St. Albans Psalter was removed from its binding and in 2012 the disbound leaves traveled to the J. Paul Getty Museum, where scholars, conservators, and scientists conducted a close examination.

We now think nothing of hearing voices--our own and others'--propelled over intercoms, cellphones, and answering machines. Yet, why can none of us hear our own recorded voice without wincing? Why is the telephone still full of such spookiness and erotic possibility? And why does the magician's trick of speaking through a dummy entertain as well as disturb us? These are the kind of questions which impel <em>Dumbstruck</em>, Steven Connor's wide-ranging, relentlessly inquisitive history of ventriloquism and the disembodied voice.<br> Connor follows his subject from its early beginnings in ancient Israel and Greece, through the outcries of early Christian writers against the unholy (and, they believed, obscenely produced) practices of pagan divination. Surprisingly, he finds that women like the sibyls of Delphi were the key voices in these male-dominated times. Connor then turns to the aberrations of the voice in mysticism, witchcraft and possession, and the strange cultural obsession with the vagrant figure of the ventriloquist, newly conceived as male rather than female, that flourished during the Enlightenment. He retells the stories of some of the most popular and versatile ventriloquists and polyphonists of the nineteenth century, and investigates the survival of ventriloquial delusions and desires in spiritualism and the 'vocalic uncanny' of technologies like the telephone, radio, film, and the internet.<br> Brimming with anecdote and insight, <em>Dumbstruck</em> is a provocative archeology of a seemingly trivial yet profoundly relevant presence in human history. Its pages overflow with virtuoso philosophical and psychological reflections on the problems and astonishments, the raptures and absurdities of the unhoused voice.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Connor</strong> was educated at Christ's Hospital Horsham and Wadham College, Oxford, and has taught at Birkbeck College, University of London since 1979.

Crowner sews together painted panels of canvas, raw linen and monochromatic fabrics, introducing a handmade touch to modernist aesthetics that often espoused the minimizing of the artist&#x2019;s hand. Crowner&#x2019;s first large-scale artist&#x2019;s book extends this instinct for materiality to her vast archive of ephemera (magazines, publications, posters) from the 1920s through the 1940s, which she deploys here as a source material for the creation of new images that are built up through imposition, extraction, collaging and printing. Much like her paintings, the resulting works are geometrical and optical abstractions that bring fresh vigor to the tradition on which Crowner draws.</p><p></p><h2>Phoenix: Therapeutic Patterns of Milton H. Erickson</h2><p>Although many descriptive and evaluative articles have been written about Milton Erickson&#39;s hypnotic work, relatively little attention has been accorded that tremendous portion of his therapeutic work that made little or no use of formal trance states. In this volume the authors address thenselves to those aspects of Erickson&#39;s therapeutic work that did not rely on the utilization of formal trance states. Using Erickson&#39;s own verbatim descriptions of this work, those patterns which are characteristic of his approach are not only identified for the reader, but are described as sequenses of internal and external behaviors that can be duplicated by anyone.</p><p>I had the privilege of reading David Gordan and Maribeth Meyers-Anderson&#39;s book, Phoenix, in manuscript.

It provides a thorough discussion of the specifics of banking, insurance, pension funds, and mutual funds. In a similar fashion, the book elucidates the general principles and economic functions common to all financial markets and offers an in-depth look at the specifics of the particular markets for government securities, mortgages, corporate debt, equity, and derivatives. The final section addresses the management of liquidity and risk and discusses the safety, stability, and regulation of financial intermediaries and financial markets. <br> Each chapter begins with a list of study objectives and concludes with a summary.

Do antipoverty programs work on the ground? In this eye-opening analysis, Erica Kohl-Arenas bores deeply into how these issues play out in California&#x2019;s Central Valley, which is one of the wealthiest agricultural production regions in the world and also home to the poorest people in the United States.<br><br> Through the lens of a provocative set of case studies, <i>The Self-Help Myth</i> reveals how philanthropy maintains systems of inequality by attracting attention to the behavior of poor people while shifting the focus away from structural inequities and relationships of power that produce poverty. In Fresno County, for example, which has a $5.6 billion-plus agricultural industry, migrant farm workers depend heavily on food banks, religious organizations, and family networks to feed and clothe their families. Foundation professionals espouse well-intentioned, hopeful strategies to improve the lives of the poor. These strategies contain specific ideas&#x2014;in philanthropy terminology, &#x201c;theories of change&#x201d;&#x2014; that rely on traditional American ideals of individualism and hard work, such as self-help, civic participation, and mutual prosperity. But when used in partnership with well-defined limits around what foundations will and will not fund, these ideals become fuzzy concepts promoting professional and institutional behaviors that leave relationships of poverty and inequality untouched.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>"In a field dominated by shallow analysis and self-promotion, <i>The Self Help Myth </i>stands out as a model of engaged and critical scholarship. Beautifully written and carefully researched, this book is a must-read for anyone concerned with transforming philanthropy into a genuine force for social change."&#x2014;Michael Edwards, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Demos<p>"<i>The Self-Help Myth</i> offers a stunning example of the failure of philanthrocapitalism and NGO humanitarianism to solve long-standing problems of poverty in America among migrant farmworkers. Using history and ethnography, Kohl-Arenas shows in gripping detail how oppositional tactics become entangled in day-to-day policy-making practices, reducing real labor crises to rhetorical problems of innovation, self-help and cooperation&#x2014;the ultimate co-optation of political resistance. This book provides a critical missing link in the literature that critically scrutinizes neoliberal tactics for provisioning the safety net in America."&#x2014;Vincanne Adams, Professor of Medical Anthropology, University of California, San Francisco, and author of <i>Markets of Sorrow, Labors of Faith</i><br><br> "<i>The Self-Help Myth</i>&nbsp;goes beyond simplistic dichotomies of philanthropic empowerment and cooptation to vividly convey the complex realities and on-the-ground power dynamics behind the funder&#x2019;s rhetoric. Kohl-Arenas combines nuanced ethnography and compelling historical analysis to show how the structural interests of philanthropic foundations remain at odds with their stated goals to reduce poverty and inequality."&#x2014;Alyosha Goldstein,&nbsp;Associate Professor of&nbsp;American Studies, University of New Mexico, and author of&nbsp;<i>Poverty in Common: The Politics of Community Action during the American Century</i></p><br><b>Erica Kohl-Arenas </b>is Assistant Professor at the Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at The New School in New York.<br></p><h2>Students Companion International Edition.

Narrated by an unheroic, apparently rudderless hero named Random, Smollett&#39;s wildly energetic and entertaining novel is held together not least by the narrator&#39;s outrage and dismay. Although Roderick Random was first published anonymously, the secret of Smollett&#39;s authorship was soon discovered, with the result that many readers thought they recognized similarities between the life of the hero and that of his creator. Certainly Roderick Random&#39;s early years - disinherited and without wealth and influence - and his university career, apprenticeship and service as a naval surgeon, vividly reflect the experiences of the author. How Random learns to survive the fickle hand of fortune, recovers his long-lost father, marries his beloved Narcissa, and dispatches his enemies is the stuff, not of autobiography but of a novel which profoundly satirizes the moral chaos of its times. Dickens and Thackeray, among other great Victorians, applauded Smollett for his wit and invention, and in Roderick Random we enjoy the novel of a pioneer opening up the frontiers of fiction.Anthony Trollope (24 April 1815- 6 December 1882) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Some of his best-loved works, the Chronicles of Barsetshire, revolve around the imaginary county of Barsetshire Dinah Birch writes regularly for the London Review of Books and the Times Literary Supplement.

Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves</i> explores how that history of slavery and its violent end was told in public space--specifically in the sculptural monuments that increasingly came to dominate streets, parks, and town squares in nineteenth-century America. Here Kirk Savage shows how the greatest era of monument building in American history arose amidst struggles over race, gender, and collective memory. As men and women North and South fought to define the war's legacy in monumental art, they reshaped the cultural landscape of American nationalism.</p><br><p> At the same time that the Civil War challenged the nation to reexamine the meaning of freedom, Americans began to erect public monuments as never before. Savage studies this extraordinary moment in American history when a new interracial order seemed to be on the horizon, and when public sculptors tried to bring that new order into concrete form. Looking at monuments built and unbuilt, Savage shows how an old image of black slavery was perpetuated while a new image of the common white soldier was launched in public space. Faced with the challenge of Reconstruction, the nation ultimately recast itself in the mold of the ordinary white man.</p><br><br><p> <i>Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves</i>, the first sustained investigation of monument building as a process of national and racial definition, probes a host of fascinating questions: How was slavery to be explained without exploding the myth of a "united" people? How did notions of heroism become racialized? And more generally, who is represented in and by monumental space? How are particular visions of history constructed by public monuments? Written in an engaging fashion, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers interested in American culture, race relations, and public art.</p></p><p><i>Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves</i> is a history of race in America as seen through the depiction of slavery in sculptures and monuments. Kirk Savage, an assistant professor of art history at the University of Pittsburgh, shows that blacks were seldom depicted in sculpture until after the Civil War, at which time there was a nationwide impetus to commemorate the end of the war and emancipation. Savage considers these statues and monuments to be a lost opportunity: instead of representing a new sense of race in America, the statues featured old stereotypes, the "kneeling slaves" of the title. Far more common were statues featuring ordinary soldiers. The great irony, Savage argues in this thought-provoking book, is that black soldiers--who "were most clearly representative of a national purpose," the fight for equality--were seldom represented in celebratory monuments.<p>"Kirk Savage joins the growing literature on the politics of public memory and commemoration with the rich scholarship on race and nationhood. His book is a finely conceptualized, beautifully argued study of the challenges of representing the new postwar relationship of black to white."--<b>Angela Miller, Washington University</b></p> <p>"In my town there are equestrian statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson (Nat Turner has not yet found his monument, to say nothing of Sojourner Truth). In nearby Richmond, a twenty-four-foot statue of Arthur Ashe is dwarfed by sixty-foot statues of Lee and other Confederate heroes. Kirk Savage's <i>Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves</i> eloquently and authoritatively exposes the way racial dominance has been literally built into the public space that surrounds us--space in which it is, for this reason, increasingly difficult to live."--<b>Eric Lott, University of Virginia, author of <i>Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class</i></b></p> <p>"In a fascinating study of public space and the less-than-public contradictions of nineteenth-century culture, Kirk Savage sheds light not only on memory and monument, but also on the invention of the `popular' itself."--<b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b></p> <p>"A finely conceptualized, beautifully argued study of the challenges of representing the new postwar relationship of black to white."--<b>Angela Miller, Washington University</b></p></p><h2>Taking Sides: Clashing Views in Crime and Criminology</h2><p>The <b>Taking Sides Collection</b> on McGraw-Hill Create&#x2122; includes current controversial issues in a debate-style format designed to stimulate student interest and develop critical thinking skills.

John Hall The Trollope Society 1992 London</p><p>Anthony Trollope&#39;s father, Thomas Anthony Trollope, worked as a barrister. Thomas Trollope, though a clever and well-educated man and a Fellow of New College, Oxford, failed at the bar due to his bad temper. In addition, his ventures into farming proved unprofitable and he lost an expected inheritance when an elderly uncle married and had children. Nonetheless, he came from a genteel background, with connections to the landed gentry, and so wished to educate his sons as gentlemen and for them to attend Oxford or Cambridge. The disparity between his family&#39;s social background and its poverty would be the cause of much misery to Anthony Trollope during his boyhood. Born in London, Anthony attended Harrow School as a day-boy for three years from the age of seven, as his father&#39;s farm lay in that neighbourhood. After a spell at a private school, he followed his father and two older brothers to Winchester College, where he remained for three years. He returned to Harrow as a day-boy to reduce the cost of his education. Trollope had some very miserable experiences at these two public schools. They ranked as two of the most �lite schools in England, but Trollope had no money and no friends, and got bullied a great deal. At the age of twelve, he fantasized about suicide. However, he also daydreamed, constructing elaborate imaginary worlds. In 1827, his mother Frances Trollope moved to America with Trollope&#39;s three younger siblings, where she opened a bazaar in Cincinnati, which proved unsuccessful. Thomas Trollope joined them for a short time before returning to the farm at Harrow, but Anthony stayed in England throughout. His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father&#39;s affairs, however, went from bad to worse. He gave up his legal practice entirely and failed to make enough income from farming to pay rents to his landlord Lord Northwick. In 1834 he fled to Belgium to avoid arrest for debt. The whole family moved to a house near Bruges, where they lived entirely on Frances&#39;s earnings. In 1835, Thomas Trollope died. While living in Belgium, Anthony worked as a Classics usher (a junior or assistant teacher) in a school with a view to learning French and German, so that he could take up a promised commission in an Austrian cavalry regiment, which had to be cut short at six weeks.</p><h2>The Primitive Edge of Experience</h2><p>'This is an extraordinary and exciting book, the work of a truly original and creative psychoanalytic theoretician and most astute clinician. Ogden continues to expand and to deepen his reformulations of the British object-relations theorists, M. Klein, W. R. Bion, D. W. Winnicott, W. R. D. Fairbairn, H. Guntrip, to illuminate further the world of internalized object relations. His concepts are evolutionary and at times revolutionary. Exploring the area of human experience that lies beyond the psychological territories addressed by the previous theorists, he introduces the concept of an autistic-contiguous mode as a way of conceiving of the most primitive psychological organization through which the sensory 'floor' of the experience of self is generated. He conceives of this mode as a sensory-dominated, presymbolic area of experience in which the most primitive form of meaning is generated on the basis of organization of sensory impressions, particularly at the skin surface. A major tenet in the book is a conceptualization of human experience throughout life as the product of a dialectical interplay among three modes of generating experience: the depressive, the paranoid-schizoid, and the autistic-contiguous. Each mode creates, preserves, and negates the other. No single mode of generating experience exists independently of the others. Psychopathology is conceptualized as a 'collapse' of the dialectic in the direction of one or another mode of generating experience. The outcome of such collapse may be entrapment in rigid, asymbolic patterns of sensation (collapse in the direction of the autistic-contiguous mode), or imprisonment in a world of omnipotent internal objects where thoughts and feelings are experienced as things and forces which occupy or bombard the self (collapse in the direction of paranoid-schizoid mode) or isolation of the self from lived experience and aliveness of bodily, sensations (collapse in the direction of the depressive mode). Ogden presents his unique development of the autistic-contiguous mode as the synthesis, interpretation, and extension of the works of D. Meltzer, E. Bick, and F. Tustin. He is careful to state that this psychological organization is a developing and ongoing) mode of generating experience and not a limited phase of development; an elaboration of this primitive organization is an integral part of normal development. All three modes are considered not 'positions' to be passed through, outgrown, or overcome, and relegated to the past, but as integral dimensions of present adult ego functioning. Sensory experience in an autistic-contiguous mode has rhythmicity that is becoming the continuity of being; it has boundedness that is the beginning of experience of the place where one feels things and lives; it has features such as shape, hardness, cold, warmth and texture, beginnings of the qualities of who one is. As his generous case examples aptly demonstrate, Ogden's theories are solidly grounded in his discerning work with a broad variety of patients. His brilliant pathfinding will enlighten and enrich the reader with invaluable insights. He will listen with new ears and with a fresh conceptual framework with which to comprehend the most primitive elements of human development and the complex interplay among the different modes of experience. This is a bold, important, instructive, and stimulating book of equally great clinical and theoretical applicability.' &#x2015;The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association A Jason Aronson Book</p><p>Thomas H. Ogden, M.D., is a graduate of Amherst College, the Yale School of Medicine, and the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute. He has served as an associate psychiatrist at the Tavistock Clinic, London, and is currently Co-director of the Center for the Advanced Study of the Psychoses, a member of the faculty of the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute, and a supervising and personal analyst at the Psychoanalytic Institute of Northern California. He teaches, supervises, and maintains a private practice of psychoanalysis in San Francisco.Reading this book left me feeling that I had come across one of those rare works which induce us to rethink, in an unaccustomed way, our ideas about mental functioning and the analytic process. Its gentle and unpretentious style leads you by the hand through an array of English and French analytic works which are less familiar to the American reader, such as Klein, Bion, Bollas, Bick, Meltzer, Fairbairn, Tustin and Winnicott, on to Anzieu, Green, McDougall, Chasseguet-Smirgel and, finally, Lacan. This isadded to many American writers who are much more familiar... (Monique V. King)<br><br>In this magnificent book, Ogden illuminates the darkest recesses of the human psyche with his brilliant formulation of the autistic-contiguous position. He also provides refreshing new perspectives on the Oedipus complex and female psychology. With this impressive contribution, Thomas Ogden has come into his own as one of the most creative and original psychoanalytic thinkers of our time....

The computers and smart phones that constantly flood us with images do more than simply convey information. They structure our relationship to information through graphical formats. Learning to interpret how visual forms not only present but produce knowledge, says Johanna Drucker, has become an essential contemporary skill.</p><p><i>Graphesis</i> provides a descriptive critical language for the analysis of graphical knowledge. In an interdisciplinary study fusing digital humanities with media studies and graphic design history, Drucker outlines the principles by which visual formats organize meaningful content. Among the most significant of these formats is the graphical user interface (GUI)--the dominant feature of the screens of nearly all consumer electronic devices. Because so much of our personal and professional lives is mediated through visual interfaces, it is important to start thinking critically about how they shape knowledge, our behavior, and even our identity.</p><p>Information graphics bear tell-tale signs of the disciplines in which they originated: statistics, business, and the empirical sciences. Drucker makes the case for studying visuality from a humanistic perspective, exploring how graphic languages can serve fields where qualitative judgments take priority over quantitative statements of fact. <i>Graphesis </i>offers a new epistemology of the ways we process information, embracing the full potential of visual forms and formats of knowledge production.</p></p><p>Johanna Drucker is Breslauer Professor of Bibliographical Studies at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.&#x201c;The pages of <i>Graphesis</i> teem with color reproductions of 5,000 years&#x2019; worth of various modes of visually rendered knowledge&#x2015;showing how they have emerged and developed over time, growing familiar but also defining or reinforcing ways to apprehend information...

We come and go, but the land is always here. And the people who love it and understand it are the people who own it -- for a little while." <p>O Pioneers! (1913) was Willa Cather's first great novel, and to many it remains her unchallenged masterpiece. No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier -- and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself.</p> <p>At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, O Pioneers! is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were.</p></p><h2>Analytical Key to the Old Testament, vol. 2: Judges&#x2013;2 Chronicles (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>Readers discover a more accurate understanding of the Bible with this guide, which translates and identifies words and phrases.

Whistle-blowers can increase the safety and effectiveness of their organization, boost employee morale, prevent escalation of wrongdoing, and help their organization avoid litigation and legal regulation. On the other hand, they can undermine the legitimate management of their organization, subject the firm to public scandal and huge lawsuits, and even threaten its very survival. In providing an authoritative review of the theories and implications of whistle-blowing, Marcia P. Miceli and Janet P. Near explain the many reasons some individuals decide to &#34;turn in&#34; their companies, why some organizations seem prone to whistle-blowing, and how to prevent the problems that lead to it. They identify the common traits of whistle-blowers and the organizations in which they are active, demonstrating that, contrary to popular ideas, whistle-blowers are generally not disgruntled underperformers or former employees. They are more often highly satisfied, well paid, high-performing workers, and are likely to be older, better educated, and to have worked for the organization for a long time. Miceli and Near assert that no organization should strive to be free of whistle-blowers. Since wrongdoing is inevitable in any organization, they argue, so is the need for whistle-blowers. As preventive measures, organizations should develop &#34;living&#34; codes of conduct, train employees to deter wrongdoing, and provide rewards for ethical behavior. The authors encourage speedy, impartial internal complaint procedures with designated complaint recipients, and swift corrective measures once wrongdoing is identified.Whistle-blowers should be kept informed of the investigation into their charges, and rewarded rather than punished for their actions. And to assure that whistle-blowers aren&#39;t being unjustly terminated, all firings should be reviewed by an impartial authority. Blowing the Whistle, with its extensive empirical research, will be an important volume for academics in management, human resources, and organizational psychology. Managers will find the material on the practical and legal implications of whistle-blowing helpful in responding to their employees&#39; complaints and in curtailing wrongdoing. And for those employees who are contemplating sounding the alarm on their organizations, Miceli and Near offer guidelines on how whistle-blowers can enhance their effectiveness and avoid retaliation.</p><h2>The Complete Works of Flavius Josephus - Legendary Jewish Historian and His Chronicle of Ancient History</h2><p><p><strong>Explore the history of first century Jews from the eyewitness account of Flavius Josephus, legendary Jewish historian.</strong> His extra-biblical account offers fascinating historical context to enhance your study of primeval Jewish, Christian, and Roman history.

First developing the critical methodology needed to examine the journal form, a genre long neglected by literary scholars, Rosenwald goes on to consider how Emerson the diarist found his form and what form he found. Included are comparisons between the journals and Emerson's lectures and essays, other Transcendentalist journals, the German aphorism-book, and books of quotation by Montaigne and Eckermann. Finally, the author gives an account of how, in his old age, Emerson lost his mastery of the form.<br></p><p>The book&#39;s argument begins with sharp refutation of common fallacies about journals and diaries generally, thus establishing a set of requirements for the study of any diary.Lawrence Rosenwald is at Wellesley College.</p><h2>Leaves From A Child&#39;s Garden of Verses</h2><p>A sampling of poems from Stevenson&#39;s 1885 collection, with illustrations reflecting the era when the poems were first written</p><p>No volume of children's poetry has left such an indelible mark on so many generations of devoted readers as this Robert Louis Stevenson classic. First published in 1885, Stevenson's sentimental tribute to the joys of childhood has stood the test of time--it has never been out of print. And so thorough was his understanding of the child psyche and that special place all children create--a world of imagination filled with castles and kings, clipper ships, pirates, and faraway places--that grown ups have also adopted it as a favorite reminder of the imaginary world in which they too once lived.<p> Small wonder that over the years an entire galaxy of great artists has chosen to illustrate Stevenson's work. Thus has New England artist Donna Green, noted for her paintings depicting children at play, joined this illustrious list.</p><p> <i>Leaves From a Child's Garden of Verses</i> will be cherished for the joyous view of our youth it presents.

The result is a valuable document of its era, a treasure trove of gossip and creative insight, and a handbook for surviving as an artist in the face of indifference and oppression, and its message urgently deserves to be heard at a moment when what Kushner calls &#x201c;the Great Work&#x201d; prepares to begin yet again.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alec Nevala-Lee, author of ASTOUNDING: JOHN W.

The book provides students with supporting and contradictory evidence for the development of personality theories through time. Without condemning the founding theorists who came before him, Ellis builds on more than a century of psychological research to re-examine the theories of Freud, Jung, and Adler while taking an equally critical look at modern, research-based theories, including his own. <br></p><p><p><strong>Albert Ellis, Ph.D.,</strong> was the intellectual founder of all clinical approaches that now fall under the rubric of cognitive behavior therapy, and he is generally regarded as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century. His Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy is now practiced and taught throughout the world, along with the numerous similar therapies that it spawned. Dr. Ellis wrote 70 books and more than 600 journal articles and monographs. At the Albert Ellis Institute, which he founded and managed for more than half a century, he personally trained or supervised thousands of clinicians. As a practicing psychologist, he personally helped more than 10,000 people lead less painful and more productive lives. Dr. Ellis received dozens of awards from organizations like the American Psychological Association and American Counseling Association for his tireless work in advancing psychology, counseling, and social work. When he received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1947, he had already established himself as the most renowned sex therapist in the first half of the 20th century, and he then went on to revolutionize the field of clinical psychology. Dr. Ellis died July 24, 2007, while this book was in the final stages of preparation.</p><em>"Finally, an empirically based, critical examination of personality theories." </em> Author: Richard W.

It mobilised over three million supporters at its height. Few modern European social movements, certainly in Britain, have captured the attention of posterity to quite the extent it has done. Encompassing moments of great drama, it is one of the very rare points in British history where it is legitimate to speculate how close the country came to revolution. It is also pivotal to debates around continuity and change in Victorian Britain, gender, language and identity. <br><br>Chartism: A New History is the only book to offer in-depth coverage of the entire chronological spread (1838-58) of this pivotal movement and to consider its rich and varied history in full. Based throughout on original research (including newly discovered material) this is a vivid and compelling narrative of a movement which mobilised three million people at its height. <br><br>The author deftly intertwines analysis and narrative, interspersing his chapters with short &#x2018;Chartist Lives&#x2019;, relating the intimate and personal to the realm of the social and political.

In this wide-ranging collection of essays, Theda Skocpol shows how historical understanding, centered on governmental institutions and political alliances, can illuminate the limits and possibilities of American social policymaking both past and present. Skocpol dispels the myth that Americans are inherently hostile to social spending and suggests why President Clinton's health care agenda was so quickly attacked despite the support of most Americans for his goals.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Social Policy in the United States</i> bears out Skocpol's reputation as the preeminent scholar of the history of social policymaking in the United States.

In <i>Walking and Mapping</i>, Karen O'Rourke explores a series of walking/mapping projects by contemporary artists. She offers close readings of these projects&#x2015;many of which she was able to experience firsthand&#x2015;and situates them in relation to landmark works from the past half-century. Together, they form a new entity, a dynamic whole greater than the sum of its parts.

The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Mystical speculations about God, the world, and man occupied the minds of many medieval scholars and theologians. They conceived creation itself to be a symbol or figure through which the Divine Will manifested its purposes and intentions-thus by analogy, the world revealed God, and man revealed the world. The human being himself was a microcosm-a miniature of the cosmos. After the collapse of the pagan cultural institutions, it was unlawful to teach classical learning or to advance scientific knowledge contrary to the prevailing scholasticism. To avoid persecution and at the same time perpetuate for the benefit of qualified disciples the more advanced formulas of the ancient wisdom, the sacred truths were presented symbolically through the beautiful engraved devices of the emblem writers. <p>The seventeenth century restoration of learning gradually brought about a Universal Reformation as proclaimed in the Fama of the Rosicrucians. A careful study of the emblem books of that period reveals that most of the figures and designs were based upon Egyptian or Greek mythology, and like the alchemical symbols, perpetuated the secret teachings of esoteric fraternities. Today, those well informed in the Orphic Mysteries and the mystical speculations of the Neoplatonists can interpret the design with little difficulty. It appears that the emblem books were, in many cases, actual extensions of Pythagorean and Platonic metaphysics. Paracelsus said that the first hieroglyphic book is nature, published in folio, and the second hieroglyphic book is man, published in duodecimo. </p><p>To live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books. It has always seemed to me that symbolism should be restored to the structure of world education. The young are no longer invited to seek the hidden truths, dynamic and eternal, locked within the shapes and behavior of living beings. </p><p>The present volume is itself a symbol made up of many symbols gathered from rare sources. It invites the thoughtful reader to explore the meanings of these emblems and devices with his own insight. Because spiritual growth is the goal of all human aspiration, symbols that help us to grow are precious things for they open the doors to life everlasting. </p><p>I wish to express my deep indebtedness to those faithful artists and engravers whose remarkable meditation pictures have guided my labors for so many years. This book is dedicated to the truths they served and the wonderful designs which they have bestowed as a priceless heritage upon the truth seekers of the future. It is my sincere hope that this memorial may continue to serve and inspire new generations of kindly and dedicated people. </p><p>Manly P. Hall Los Angeles, California October 1, 1975.</p></p><h2>Roland Barthes: A Biography</h2><p>This is a biography of Roland Barthes - one of the most important European intellectuals of the post-war years. In a lively account of Barthes&#39;s life and work, Calvet follows the brilliant semiotician from his provincial origins to his sudden death in 1980. He describes Barthes&#39;s move to Paris as a child, where he lived with his mother in modest surroundings and constant hardship. He argues that the experience of having his academic prospects ruined by his illness at an early age remained a thorn in Barthes&#39;s flesh: until the end of his life his relationship with the academic world was never free of bitterness, even resentment. Calvet retraces his years in Paris, Bucharest and Alexandria after the war. During this period Barthes gained access to intellectual circles and experienced his decisive encounter with modern linguistics, particularly with &#34;semiotics&#34;, which he helped to establish as a discipline through his work on everyday myths, fashion and literature. Calvet discusses the whole range of Barthes&#39;s work as a critic and literary theorist, and demonstrates his tremendous importance and influence in the second half of the 20th century. This book provides a detailed portrait of Barthes&#39;s life, and a vivid reconstruction of the intellectual culture of post-war France. It should be of interest to students and researchers in literature, cultural studies, French studies, and anyone interested in the life and work of Roland Barthes.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French"Succinct, accesible and witty ... Calvet deftly sketches a unified portrait of the man and his work." <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <p>"Calvet admirably traverses the texts surrounding the life of the writer with sympathy and detached scholarship." <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></p> <p><br> "Well researched. Besides Barthes's depression after his mother's death ... and his cryptic allusions to his desire to write a literary work, several other "biographemes" evoked by Calvet are touching and telling; his love for Schumann's piano music, his "doodling", his cigars, his overeating, his frequent "boredom", the fragile yet firm "grain" of his voice. Calvet also approaches, with sensitivity, the importance of homosexuality to Barthes's life and work." <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p> <p><br> "Calvet's biography is a wide stop-gap which ... succeeds in demonstrating that Roland Barthes was an utterly captivating individual." <i>The Independent on Sunday</i></p> <p>"Barthes has been fortunate in another way, for Calvet is an unfashionably courteous biographer." <i>The Guardian</i></p> <p>"Enjoyable ... it provides a good overview of an unexpectedly uncertain career." <i>Radical Philosophy</i></p> <p> "From <i>Writing Degree Zero</i> to the haunting late essays, Roland Barthes's astonishing critical intelligence lived its own life, and the story that a mrere Barthes biographer can hope to tell is likely to be banal and bathetic in comparison. Calvet in his compelling new book avoids this danger by giving the public face of Barthes's ideas a central role in his narrative." <i>Malcolm Bowie, University of Oxford</i></p></p><h2>En Un Acto: Diez Piezas Hispanoamericanas (Spanish and English Edition)</h2><p>This is the only reader that comprises complete one-act plays by noted Hispanic authors.</p><p></p><h2>Weird But True ! 1, 350 Outrageous Facts</h2><p><b>Did you know that peanut butter can be turned into a diamond?

Written in the 1940s but left unpublished until 1990, Chromos anticipated the fictional inventiveness of the writers who were to come along&#x2015;Barth, Coover, Pynchon, Sorrentino, and Gaddis.<br><br>On one level, Chromos is the American immigration novel par excellence. Its opening line is: &#x201c;The moment one learns English, complications set in.&#x201d; Or, as the novel illustrates, the moment one comes to America, the complications set in. The cast of characters in this book are immigrants from Spain who have one leg in Spanish culture and the other in the confusing, warped, unfriendly New World of New York City, attempting to meld the two worlds that just won&#x2019;t fit together.<br><br>While wildly comic and populated with some of the most bizarre characters, Chromos is also strangely apocalyptic, moving towards point zero and utter darkness.</p><p>Joseph Coates is the author of 2025: Scenarios of US and Global Society Reshaped by Science and Technology.This kaleidoscopic novel was written in 1948 and is here offered in English for the first time after the recent reissue of the same author's Locos ( LJ 2/1/89). The focus is on a group of "Americaniards," Spaniards residing in New York City who, although healthy back home, have become hypochondriacal and readily indulge in delusions of mediocrity. Typical is the writer Garcia, who is adept at loitering in a city remarkable for its absence of cafe life and who sells to lesser Latin American reviews an article invariably about New York, a short story invariably about Spain, or a poem invariably about himself. With the hapless narrator, Garcia shares long segments of his deliberately corny novel about a merchant family of Madrid whose third-generation males fall prey to sexual perversions. Richly aphoristic, with titillating digressions into mathematics and metaphysics and with many Spanish words left untranslated, this book represents intellectual fiction at its best.<br><i>- Jack Shreve, Allegany Community Coll., Cumberland, Md.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Human Competence: Engineering Worthy Performance</h2><p>What People Have Said About <i>Human Competence</i>:<p>"Among the ideas bulging from this classic work: performance exemplars, potential for improving performance, behavior-accomplishment distinction, performance matrix, ACORN troubleshooting test, performance audits, states, Worth = Value - Cost, knowledge maps, mediators, and job aids.

The crisis of the Great Depression had brought into government a group of policy experts who argued that saving democracy required attacking economic and social inequalities. The influence of these men and women within the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, and their alliances with progressive social movements, elicited a powerful reaction from conservatives, who accused them of being subversives. Landon Storrs draws on newly declassified records of the federal employee loyalty program&#x2015;created in response to claims that Communists were infiltrating the U.S. government&#x2015;to reveal how disloyalty charges were used to silence these New Dealers and discredit their policies.</p><br><p>Because loyalty investigators rarely distinguished between Communists and other leftists, many noncommunist leftists were forced to leave government or deny their political views. Storrs finds that loyalty defendants were more numerous at higher ranks of the civil service than previously thought, and that many were women, or men with accomplished leftist wives. Uncovering a forceful left-feminist presence in the New Deal, she also shows how opponents on the Right exploited popular hostility to powerful women and their supposedly effeminate spouses. The loyalty program not only destroyed many promising careers, it prohibited discussion of social democratic policy ideas in government circles, narrowing the scope of political discourse to this day.</p><br><p>Through a gripping narrative based on remarkable new sources, Storrs demonstrates how the Second Red Scare repressed political debate and constrained U.S. policymaking in fields such as public assistance, national health insurance, labor and consumer protection, civil rights, and international aid.</p></p><p><p>"Riveting and timely. Storrs cuts through the endless debates on the impact of the Second Red Scare to show in concrete detail how it destroyed a vibrant social-democratic tradition in American politics. Mining never before used sources, she also demonstrates how important the feminist Left was to the New Deal and how central antifeminism was to the Right. Anyone who cares about the policy challenges of our own time should read this book."<b>--Jacquelyn Hall, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</b></p><p>"This is the most original and important book on the New Deal in years. Landon Storrs reveals for the first time how conservatives silenced visionary social-democratic women and men, who came closer than we've ever realized to creating an inclusive America. With heroic detective work, Storrs has uncovered a national tragedy of epic proportions."<b>--Nancy MacLean, author of <i>Freedom Is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Workplace</i></b></p><p>"In this devastating yet fair-minded account of the hitherto unknown impact of the federal loyalty-security program on the New Deal's noncommunist radicals and feminists, Landon Storrs has produced what is by far the best book on the political consequences of the Cold War Red Scare in Washington."<b>--Ellen Schrecker, Yeshiva University</b></p><p>"This richly detailed and fluently written study forces us to rethink the ideology of New Deal policymakers, both women and men, and the aims of their well-entrenched conservative opponents. As Storrs makes clear, the political conflict that raged during the 1930s and 1940s has, in many ways, continued into our own time."<b>--Michael Kazin, author of <i>American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation</i></b></p><p>"This important book provides a fresh look at the chilling effect of the loyalty hearings in 1940s and 1950s America. Storrs argues that the anticommunist crusade had an impact above and beyond ruining lives. It changed the political discourse of the country, undermined any move toward social democracy, impeded feminism, and was far more corrosive than we think. <i>The Second Red Scare and the Unmaking of the New Deal Left</i> is an outstanding work of scholarship."<b>--Allan M.

Data sets are taken from real experiments and sample SAS programs are included with each chapter. Experimental design is an essential part of investigation and discovery in science; this book will serve as a modern and comprehensive reference to the subject.</p><p><p>This is a readable book presenting the basic concepts, principles, and techniques of design and analysis of experiments. Written with a view to making it accessible to a wide audience, the authors make concerted efforts to avoid using calculus and linear algebra and, wherever needed, a low mathematical level is used for presentation. Rather than performing exploratory data analysis, the concentration here is on the use of prespecified models and preplanned analyses. Model assumptions are clearly stated, and checked through the use of residual plots rather than formal tests. All analyses are presented by using standard linear models under the assumption of normality. It is the experimentwise control of the error rate and confidence levels on which the presentation is focused as opposed to individual error rates and confidence levels. The popular "Taguchi techniques", used extensively in an industrial set-up, are included and appear throughout several chapters. </p> <p>The book contains enough material for an instructor to offer a course ranging from one semester to one year. An attractive feature of this book is the inclusion of numerous real experiments which were either run by students or extracted from published articles---thus bringing home to students the practical utility of statistical designs. The authors have done a commendable job in presenting, explaining, and elucidating the fundamental concepts of design and analysis of experiments through illustrative examples. A carefully selected set of exercises is provided at the end of each chapter for students to test their understanding of the material. </p> <p>--Mathematical Reviews</p></p><h2>Old-Time Brand-Name Cookbook: Recipes, Illustrations, and Advice from the Early Kitchens of America&#39;s Most Trusted Food Makers</h2><p>Culled from the author&#39;s extensive collection of recipe pamphlet books from the past century, a nostalgic collection offers recipes--all updated for today&#39;s kitchen--and tips for using tried-and-true brand name products, as well as vintage artwork.</p><p><i>The Old-Time Brand-Name Cookbook</i> evokes a warm picture of cozy, sit-down family meals, comforting foods, and good old-fashioned charm. Even if this image is a little kitschy, Bunny Crumpacker's book provides a soothing escape into yesteryear. She collects more than 70 recipes--all replicating meals from the 1890s to the 1940s. The only difference between then and now is that today's chefs have the luxury of electronic food processors and large supermarkets. No longer are cooks chained to the kitchen sink! Crumpacker's recipes require the most basic of ingredients--found in the most spartan pantry--such as a nutritious recipe for a soothing pot of Cream of Onion Soup that takes only 20 minutes and requires nothing more than broth, milk, rice, and onions. The featured deserts are scrumptious and simple--say hello to Jell-o with a concoction for Pineapple Bavarian Cream, and if you have room left, indulge yourself with a bowl of Chocolate Bread Pudding. Color pictures of well-known food icons (Heinz soup, Libby's mustard, Borden's evaporated milk) illustrate this chatty and informative book throughout.

During that time he covered most of the American wilderness alone and on foot without a gun, without a sleeping bag, with only a sackful of stale bread and tea. Major credit is ascribed to him for saving the Grand Canyon and Arizona&#39;s Petrified Forest. In 1903 he convinced President Theodore Roosevelt, while on a three-day camping trip together, of the importance of a national conservation program. He had been president of the militia Sierra Club since its formation in 1892. Muir&#39;s writing, based on journals he kept throughout his life, gives our generation a picture of America only 100 years ago, still wild and unsettled. Edwin Way Teale has preserved the best of Muir&#39;s work in selections that show both the ago and the man.</p><p><strong>John Muir</strong> (1838-1914) was one of the most influential conservationists and nature writers in American history. He was&nbsp;instrumental in the creation and passage of the National Parks Act, and founder of&nbsp;the Sierra Club, acting as its&nbsp;president until his death.&nbsp;Muir was a spirit so free that all he did to prepare for an expedition was to "throw some tea and bread into an old sack and jump the back fence." &nbsp;"Reading that is often magnificent, thrilling, exciting, breathtaking, and awe-inspiring." -- -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"This admiringly edited volume is especially welcome...

It draws you into the material--and encourages a deeper understanding of the discipline--by focusing on such overarching questions as &#34;How do sociologists study society?&#34; &#34;How is society possible?&#34; &#34;Why is there misery in the world?&#34; and &#34;Are human beings free?&#34; You&#39;ll learn about the philosophies of classical sociologists such as Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Mead, and Berger, and look at how the field of sociology has approached these questions over the past 150 years. You&#39;ll also consider the benefits and drawbacks of globalization, read about how individuals can affect society, and learn how the Tea Party political movement and the revolution in Egypt illustrate social conflict.

It shows how nineteenth-century American physicians used anatomy to develop a vital professional identity, while claiming authority over the living and the dead. It also introduces the middle-class women and men, working people, unorthodox healers, cultural radicals, entrepreneurs, and health reformers who resisted and exploited anatomy to articulate their own social identities and visions.</p><br><p> The nineteenth century saw the rise of the American medical profession: a proliferation of practitioners, journals, organizations, sects, and schools. Anatomy lay at the heart of the medical curriculum, allowing American medicine to invest itself with the authority of European science. Anatomists crossed the boundary between life and death, cut into the body, reduced it to its parts, framed it with moral commentary, and represented it theatrically, visually, and textually. Only initiates of the dissecting room could claim the privileged healing status that came with direct knowledge of the body. But anatomy depended on confiscation of the dead--mainly the plundered bodies of African Americans, immigrants, Native Americans, and the poor. As black markets in cadavers flourished, so did a cultural obsession with anatomy, an obsession that gave rise to clashes over the legal, social, and moral status of the dead. Ministers praised or denounced anatomy from the pulpit; rioters sacked medical schools; and legislatures passed or repealed laws permitting medical schools to take the bodies of the destitute. Dissection narratives and representations of the anatomical body circulated in new places: schools, dime museums, popular lectures, minstrel shows, and sensationalist novels.</p><br><p> Michael Sappol resurrects this world of graverobbers and anatomical healers, discerning new ligatures among race and gender relations, funerary practices, the formation of the middle-class, and medical professionalization. In the process, he offers an engrossing and surprisingly rich cultural history of nineteenth-century America.</p></p><p><p>"This is a wonderful book--original, ambitious, fascinating, detailed--offering an important new approach to the history of scientific medicine as based on anatomical knowledge and a richly textured argument about the centrality of the anatomical body to the bourgeois American sense-of-oneself."<b>--Elizabeth Fee, author of <i>Disease and Discovery</i> and <i>Making Medical History</i></b></p><p>"This marvelous book exhibits the kind of intelligence and conceptual innovation that should attract a wide range of readers. Creative, cleverly written, and finely argued. Sappol's very smart cultural history of anatomy as both activity and ideology sketches an illuminating picture of nineteenth-century American aspiration and self-understanding."<b>--Regina Morantz-Sanchez, University of Michigan</b></p><p>"This is a well-crafted, extensively researched, fascinating study of the cultural politics of anatomy in nineteenth-century America. It explores an impressive range of cultural expressions, pulling together a disparate array of phenomena that no one has linked before. This book will be of great value to cultural and social historians as well as to historians of medicine."<b>--Karen Halttunen, University of California, Davis</b></p><b>Michael Sappol</b> holds a Ph.D. in American history from Columbia University, where he was a finalist for the Bancroft Dissertation Award and a winner of the Whiting Foundation Dissertation Fellowship and the National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Award.

This project turned into a quest to discover the secrets of the neighborhood&#x2019;s flora and fauna, and yielded more than names and trivia: Johnson developed a relationship with his nonhuman neighbors.<br><br>Johnson argues that learning to see the world afresh, like a child, shifts the way we think about nature: Instead of something distant and abstract, nature becomes real&#x2014;all at once comical, annoying, and beautiful. This shift can add tremendous value to our lives, and it might just be the first step in saving the world.<br><br>No matter where we live&#x2014;city, country, oceanside, or mountains&#x2014;there are wonders that we walk past every day. <i>Unseen City</i> widens the pinhole of our perspective by allowing us to view the world from the high-altitude eyes of a turkey vulture and the distinctly low-altitude eyes of a snail. The narrative allows us to eavesdrop on the comically frenetic life of a squirrel and peer deep into the past with a ginkgo biloba tree. Each of these organisms has something unique to tell us about our neighborhoods and, chapter by chapter, <i>Unseen City</i> takes us on a journey that is part nature lesson and part love letter to the world&#x2019;s urban jungles. With the right perspective, a walk to the subway can be every bit as entrancing as a walk through a national park.</p><p>"For days, I was reading passages from 'Unseen City' aloud and repeating my new discoveries to whoever would listen. But this is more than a trove of facts: it's a model for city living. Nathanael Johnson's curiosity is contagious--an irresistible call into the wild world waiting just steps away on the sidewalk. I loved this book."&nbsp;<i>-Robin Sloan, author of&nbsp;</i><i>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</i><i></i>"This delightful book reminds us it doesn't matter where you see nature; it's seeing nature that matters. A great addition to any city dweller's library."&nbsp;<i>-Eugenia Bone, food journalist and author of&nbsp;Mycophilia</i><br><i></i><br>"A delightful romp through the lives of species we humans (without irony!) dismiss as 'invasives'--and a very funny guide to how we in fact create our cities together with creatures and plants we barely see or acknowledge. Nathanael Johnson is now officially one of my favorite storytellers."&nbsp;<i>-Jenny Price, Urban Ranger and author of&nbsp;Flight Maps</i><br><br>"Curiosity is one of the most appealing of human qualities, and the best thing about Unseen City isn't that Johnson has it -- it's that he makes it infectious.&nbsp; Anyone can take a close look at snails -- or weeds or squirrels or ginkgos -- but Johnson, in smart, gentle prose, will make you wonder why you never did."&nbsp;<i>-Tamar Haspel,&nbsp;Washington Post columnist</i><br><br>"It might seem odd at first to have a book about the wonder of nature focusing on those familiar backyard nuisances such as pigeons and snails. But as Johnson eloquently demonstrates, if we miss what is close at hand we miss something special about what it means to be alive."<i>-Mark Lynas, environmental activist and author&nbsp;of&nbsp;The God Species</i><br><br>"The city is alive with life, crazy with biodiversity we hardly ever notice. Nathanael Johnson set out to show his daughter the wonder all around her, and here he shares that gift with you.

These significant attempts by younger recruits to the larger medical establishment to change things through eye-opening reflection and analysis, however uncomfortable, need support."&#x2015;Michael H. Kater, author of <i>Doctors under Hitler</i>, in the foreword.</p><p>The infamous Nuremberg Doctors' Trials of 1946-47 revealed horrifying crimes &#x2015;ranging from grotesque medical experiments on humans to mass murder&#x2015;committed by physicians and other health care workers in Nazi Germany. But far more common, argue the authors of <i>Cleansing the Fatherland,</i> were the doctors who profited professionally and financially from the killings but were never called to task&#x2015;and, indeed, were actively shielded by colleagues in postwar German medical organizations. </p><p>The authors examine the role of German physicians in such infamous operations as the "T 4" euthanasia program (code-named for the Berlin address of its headquarters at Number 4 Tiergartenstrasse). They also reveal details of countless lesser known killings&#x2015;all ordered by doctors and all in the name of public health. Maladjusted adolescents, the handicapped, foreign laborers too illto work, even German civilians who suffered mental breakdowns after air raids were "selected for treatment." (One physician who persisted in speaking of "killings" was officially reprimanded for his "negative attitude.")</p><p>The book also includes original documents&#x2015;never before published in English&#x2015;that give unique and chilling insight into the everyday workings of Nazi medicine. Among them:</p><p>� Minutes from a 1940 meeting of the Conference of German Mayors, at which a Nazi official gives the assembled politicians detailed instructions for the secret burial of murdered mental patients.</p><p>� A pre-Nazi era questionnaire sent by the head of a state mental institution to parents of disabled children. (Sample question: "Would you agree to a painless shortening of your child's life after an expert had determined him incurably imbecilic?" Sample answer: "Yes, but I would prefer not to know.") </p><p>� The diary of Dr. Hermann Voss, chief anatomist at the Reichs University of Posen (and later a highly respected physician in postwar Germany), who delights in the flowers blooming outside his window and worries that the overstock of Polish cadavers from his Gestapo suppliers might cause his crematory oven to break down.</p><p>� Letters of Dr. Friedrich Mennecke, director of the notorious Eichberg Clinic, who writes with cloying sentimentality to the wife he calls "mommy" and comments offhandedly about visiting concentration camps to select "patients" for death. </p><p>Today, as reports of mass death in Europe are once again cast in terms of public hygiene, and as euthanasia is advocated&#x2015;even applauded&#x2015;on U.S. television, the relevance of what Michael H.Kater here calls "the lessons of the Third Reich" is perhaps greater than ever. Against this background, <i>Cleansing the Fatherland</i> sends a stark message that is difficult to ignore.</p></p><p>&#39;The chapters in this volume painfully drive home the point that certainly as far as Germany is concerned, the lessons of the Third Reich have not yet been learned....These significant attempts by younger recruits to the larger medical establishment to change things through eye-opening reflection and analysis, however uncomfortable, need support.&#39;--Michael H.

Zhang pieces together the mystery of her father's exodus from China to the US during the two decades of civil and world war leading up to the 1949 revolution. But after a lifetime of her father's secrets and lies, Zhang's efforts to untangle the truth are thwarted by the distance between generations and her father's growing dementia. One day, late in his life, Zhang's father tells her a story she never heard before, and suddenly, all of his previous stories begin to unravel. Before she can get clarity on the new information, her father is hospitalized. Armed with history books and timelines, Zhang sits at her father's bedside recording accounts of love, espionage and betrayal, attempting to parse out the truth. Part memoir, novel and historical documentary, this hybrid text explores the silences and subterfuge of an immigrant parent, and the struggles of the second generation to understand the first.</p><p>"In comic book parlance, the blank space between illustrated panels is called 'the gutter.' It's in the gutter where the real story comes to light, where time past and time future meet, and where readers turn fragmented images into coherent narratives. In <i>Accomplice to Memory</i>, Q.M. Zhang constructs her own 'gutter' out of an assemblage of aesthetic forms--moving between photography and memoir, history and poetry, and essay and fiction--to artfully excavate the truths behind Zhang's father's escape from China and his subsequent life in the US. History is filled with the voiceless and nameless, those who have disappeared into obscurity. <i>Accomplice to Memory</i> works to revive the lost, to memorialize the author's father and the many thousands who fled the wars that roiled China during the 20th Century." --Paisley Rekdal, author of <i>Intimate: An American Family Photo Album.</i>"<i>Accomplice to Memory</i> is a stunning achievement, an exquisitely rendered map to the mysterious territory of history, memory and imagination." --Ruth Ozeki, author of <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i><br><br>"Q.M. Zhang has written one of the great fathers of recent literature, a father too large and restless for a single room. Thus, we have a whole house of him, built of memoir, fiction, documentary, and image." --Paul Lisicky, author of <i>The Narrow Door: A Memoir of Friendship</i></p><h2>Investment Philosophies: Successful Investment Philosophies and the Greatest Investors Who Made Them Work</h2><p>The philosophy behind the best investment strategies of all time<br> Investment philosophies are as unique as the individuals who practice them. In his latest endeavor, investment expert and NYU Stern School of Business professor Aswath Damodaran goes beyond investment strategies and looks at the individual underlying philosophies that support these techniques. He explores all of the time-tested investment philosophies that have worked over the long run, and discusses the greatest investors who made these philosophies so famous. Investment Philosophies will expose readers to a wide range of investment philosophies so as to give them a sense of what drives investors in each philosophy, how they attempt to put these philosophies into practice, and what determines ultimate success. In doing this, Damodaran provides an unbiased forum for the presentation of different investment philosophies, while supplying the tools-the definition and measurement of risk, the notion of market efficiency and how to test for inefficiencies, and the components and determinants of trading costs-and the empirical evidence for readers to make their own judgments on the investment philosophy that fits their specific investment goals and views of how markets work. Filled with valuable insights and expert advice, this book reveals various investment philosophies to a general audience of investors, not purely to professional investors.<br> Aswath Damodaran (New York, NY) is Professor of Finance at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. He is the author of Applied Corporate Finance (Wiley: 0-471-33042-6) and Investment Valuation (Wiley: 0-471-41488-3).</p><p>Since the inception of the financial markets, investors have been bombarded with sales pitches from experts claiming to have found the secret formula or the magic model that guarantees investment success. In one corner, you have seasoned veterans telling you to buy businesses with solid cash flows and liquid assets because that's what worked for Warren Buffett. In another, you have financial professionals advising that in the new world of technology, you have to bet on companies with solid growth prospects. And still others recommend passive index investment as the way to outperform most active investors, or nontraditional investment strategies that have worked for a select group of successful hedge funds. The only thing this barrage of claims and counterclaims has created is investor confusion.<br> <br> To successfully implement any investment strategy, you must first adopt an investment philosophy that is consistent at its core and which matches not only the markets you choose to invest in, but your personal preferences (risk tolerance, time horizons, etc.). In Investment Philosophies: Successful Strategies and the Investors Who Made Them Work, Aswath Damodaran will help you do this by going beyond the simple explanations of traditional and alternative investment strategies, to discuss the individual underlying philosophies that support these techniques.<br> <br> Investment Philosophies explores many of the time-tested investment philosophies that investors have used over the years-from value investing and growth investing to technical analysis and market timing-and discusses some of the investors who made these philosophies work. This unique book will expose you to a wide range of investment philosophies to give you a sense of what drives investors in each philosophy, how they attempt to put these philosophies into practice, and what determines ultimate success. Damodaran offers an unbiased forum for the presentation of different investment philosophies, while supplying you with the tools-the definition and measurement of risk, the notion of market efficiency and how to test for inefficiencies, the components and determinants of trading costs-and the empirical evidence to make your own judgments on the investment philosophy that fits your specific investment goals and views of how markets work.<br> <br> Filled with valuable insights, useful formulas, and comprehensive charts, this book provides you with the tools to pick an investment philosophy that is right for you.

With Investment Philosophies he provides the uncensored facts about winning in the market place. If you are a fund manager, an investor, or simply a student of finance, you will want to read this book."<br> -Tom Copeland<br> Managing Director of Corporate Finance, Monitor Group<br> <br> "Professor Damodaran has zeroed in on the most important missing element of many investment management processes: a clearly defined investment philosophy which can serve as a beacon in difficult markets. He offers a cornucopia of philosophies and strategies that have worked for many of the most successful investors, and which have stood the test of time."<br> -Rob Arnott<br> Chairman, First Quadrant, LP; Editor, Financial Analysts Journal<br> <br> "As an investor, I always have to look back to my philosophy and strategy for taking risk and making money. This book is an invaluable aid for 'taking stock' before buying stock. It lays out the concepts and tools for understanding the basics of risk and return in the stock market, and presents a framework for any investor to construct his or her own investment philosophy."<br> -Mitch Julis<br> Managing Partner, Canyon Capital Advisors<br> <br> Choosing an investment philosophy is the heart of successful investing. To make the choice, though, you need to look within before you look outside.

Lively and engaging, Lopez's book raises important questions about how Eastern religions are often co-opted, assimilated and misunderstood by Western culture."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Proceeding with care and precision, Lopez reveals the extent to which scholars have behaved like intellectual colonialists. . . . Someone had to burst the bubble of pop Tibetology, and few could have done it as resoundingly as Lopez."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Fascinating. . . [A] provocative exploration. Lopez conveys the full dizziness of the Western encounter with Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism."&#x2014;Fred Pheil, <i>Tricycle: The Buddhist Review</i><br><br>"A timely and courageous exploration. . . . [Lopez's] book will sharpen the terms of the debate over what the Tibetans and their observers can or should be doing about the place and the idea of Tibet. And that alone is what will give us all back our Shambhala."&#x2014;Jonathan Spence, <i>Lingua Franca Book Review</i><br><br>"Lopez's most important theme is that we should be wary of the idea . . . that Tibet has what the West lacks, that if we were only to look there we would find the answers to our problems. Lopez's book shows that, on the contrary, when the West has looked at Tibet, all that it has seen is a distorted reflection of itself."&#x2014;Ben Jackson, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br><br></p><p>In this book, Donald Lopez provides the first cultural history of the strange encounter between Tibetan Buddhism and the West. Charting the flights of Western fantasies of Tibet and its Buddhist legacy, Lopez presents fanciful visions of Tibetan life and religion, ranging from the utopian to the demonic. He examines, among much else, the politics of the term &#34;Lamaism&#34;, a pejorative name for Tibet&#39;s religion; the various theosophical, psychedelic, and New Age purposes served by The Tibetan Book of the Dead; the strange case of the Englishman with three eyes; and the unexpected history of the most famous of all Buddhist mantras, om mani padme hum. Throughout, Lopez demonstrates how myths of Tibet pervade both the products of pop culture and learned scholarly works.<b>Donald S. Lopez Jr.</b> is the Arthur E.

Alan Titley&#x2019;s vigorous new translation, full of the brio and guts of � Cadhain&#x2019;s original, at last brings the pleasures of this great satiric novel to the far wider audience it deserves.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Dirty Dust</i> all characters lie dead in their graves. This, however, does not impair their banter or their appetite for news of aboveground happenings from the recently arrived. Told entirely in dialogue, � Cadhain&#x2019;s daring novel listens in on the gossip, rumors, backbiting, complaining, and obsessing of the local community. In the afterlife, it seems, the same old life goes on beneath the sod. Only nothing can be done about it&#x2014;apart from talk. In this merciless yet comical portrayal of a closely bound community, � Cadhain remains keenly attuned to the absurdity of human behavior, the lilt of Irish gab, and the nasty, deceptive magic of human connection.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Cr� na Cille</i> is a work of daring imagination, filled with sly comedy. Using the voices of the dead, it dramatises the battle between life and death, time and infinity, the individual and the community. It is filled with gossip and banter, all the more lively because the voices live underground. It is the greatest novel to be written in the Irish language, and is among the best books to come out of Ireland in the twentieth century.&#x201d;&#x2014;Colm T�ib�n<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Cr� na Cille</i>&#x2014;<i>The Dirty Dust</i> is a brilliant title&#x2014;is a modern masterpiece that has remained locked away from non-Irish-speakers for too long. Alan Titley was just the man to put it into English, and I welcome this wonderfully vivid and vigorous translation.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Banville, author of <i>The Sea</i> and <i>Ancient Light</i><br><br> &#x201c;In 1949 <i>Dirty Dust</i> shook the dust from the Irish-language novel&#x2019;s feet and revealed graveyard corpses distracted by local jealousies and petty disputes assuming global importance. Sounding the death knell of pastoral romances, this modernist Irish masterpiece is hilariously funny yet scathingly honest. Titley&#x2019;s audacious adaptation offers the most popular and influential twentieth-century Irish-language novel in translation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Brian (Breen) � Conchubhair, University of Notre Dame<br><br> &#x201c;Alan Titley&#x2019;s translation has the idiomatic speed and eagerness of the original. It has a composer&#x2019;s grasp of tempo and of thematic signature. It is finally through it that we begin to see the nature of � Cadhain&#x2019;s achievement. Now, with Titley's wonderful translation, the great novel lives again.&#x201d;&#x2014;Seamus Deane, author of <i>Reading in the Dark </i>and<i> Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing</i><b>M�irt�n � Cadhain</b> (1906&#x2013;1970) is considered one of the most significant writers in the Irish language. <b>Alan Titley</b>, a novelist, story writer, playwright, and scholar, writes a weekly column for <i>The Irish Times </i>on current and cultural matters.</p><h2>What Maisie Knew (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>With an Introduction by Pat Righelato, University of Reading The child of parents who divorce, remarry and then embark on adulterous affairs, Maisie Farange survives by her intelligence and spirit. For all its sombre theme of childhood innocence exposed to a corrupted adult world, this novel is one of James&#39;s comic masterpieces. The outrageous behaviour of the characters on the seedy fringes of the English upper class is conveyed with wit and relish. The dual perspective of a sophisticated narrator richly appreciative of the absurdities of the adult sexual merry-go-round and the candid vision of Maisie, &#39;rebounding&#39; from one parent to another like a &#39;shuttlecock&#39;, together create an &#39;associational magic&#39;. Strangely, unexpectedly, from so much that is tawdry, comes a tale of moral energy and subtlety. James&#39;s foresight was in understanding the modernity of his subject, which is even more relevant today in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In the aftermath of an acrimonious divorce, young Maisie Farange finds herself shuttled back and forth between her father and mother, both of them amoral and monstrously self-involved. After her parents find new spouses&#x2014;and after the new spouses find themselves drawn to each other, as much for Maisie's sake as their own&#x2014;Maisie feels even more misplaced. As she observes the world of adults and their adulteries, and finds herself in the position to decide her own fate, Henry James's rendering of her child's-eye view&#x2014;his depiction of what precisely Maisie knows&#x2014;draws the reader into this scathing satire of social mores and insightful meditation on familial dependence. This Modern Library Paperback Classic of James's 1897 masterpiece is set from the definitive 1908 New York Edition.</p><h2>Clinical Phonetics</h2><p><b>A comprehensive introduction to the art and science of applying phonetics to clinical transcription</b> <br> <i> <b>Clinical Phonetics</b> </i> was written specifically for readers who need to know phonetic knowledge and skills for clinical purposes in speech-language pathology.

It reports on cycling trends and policies in cities in North America, Europe, and Australia, and offers information on such topics as cycling safety, cycling infrastructure provisions including bikeways and bike parking, the wide range of bike designs and bike equipment, integration of cycling with public transportation, and promoting cycling for women and children.</p><p><i>City Cycling</i> emphasizes that bicycling should not be limited to those who are highly trained, extremely fit, and daring enough to battle traffic on busy roads. The chapters describe ways to make city cycling feasible, convenient, and safe for commutes to work and school, shopping trips, visits, and other daily transportation needs. The book also offers detailed examinations and illustrations of cycling conditions in different urban environments: small cities (including Davis, California, and Delft, the Netherlands), large cities (including Sydney, Chicago, Toronto and Berlin), and &#x201c;megacities&#x201d; (London, New York, Paris, and Tokyo). These chapters offer a closer look at how cities both with and without historical cycling cultures have developed cycling programs over time. The book makes clear that successful promotion of city cycling depends on coordinating infrastructure, programs, and government policies.</p></p><p>John Pucher is Professor in the Department of Urban Planning at the Bloustein School of Planning and Policy at Rutgers University.

The emphasis is always on the individual: a victim seeking compensation, an American lawyer seeking a bonanza, the Union Carbide chairman attempting to stave off bankruptcy, an Indian politician plying his trade.

This book is a valuable resource for trauma survivors, health professionals, researchers, mindfulness practitioners, and others seeking new pathways to recovery and resilience.<br><br> It is normal to feel anxious or depressed after trauma, and to have upsetting thoughts and memories. Instead of fighting our feelings and blaming ourselves for what are actually common responses to trauma, mindfulness practices can help us tolerate and decrease distress, cultivate kindness towards ourselves and others, make wise choices, navigate attention, improve relationships, and relax&#x2015;capacities that reduce trauma symptoms and advance our overall well-being.</p><p>Practicing the small stuff can help us with the big stuff. As we learn to notice our breathing, walking, minor frustrations or daily activities with curiosity and care, we build inner resources to skillfully handle past trauma, as well as current and future challenges. Mindfulness practices can transform self-blame into self-respect and self-compassion. We can also match specific mindfulness skills to particular trauma symptoms. For example, &#x201c;grounding&#x201d; with the five senses can help us when we feel overwhelmed or spaced out, and loving-kindness meditation can alleviate self-criticism.<br><br> With this book, you will explore scientifically supported mindfulness practices, plus &#x201c;In their own words&#x201d; sections that illustrate the skills with personal stories demonstrating how mindfulness practices have helped others recover from trauma. &#x201c;Research highlight&#x201d; sections showcase fascinating scientific studies that form the basis for the book's approaches. As we practice effective strategies to handle a full range of experiences, we can each find new sources of hope, connection, and peace.</p></p><p>Rachel Goldsmith Turow, PhD, is a clinical psychologist at Seattle University and adjunct assistant professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Kearney, MD, Physician, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Professor of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This volume is packed with treasures; the author describes literally dozens of practices that those who are dealing with trauma can beneficially put to use, and which are amply illustrated by research data and by personal accounts. The mind can be our worst enemy but also our dearest friend; it can be the cause of crippling disease but, ironically, the means of healing it too. Through her insightful analogy of the 'golden mend' (kintsukuroi) Turow highlights how the places where we have been most severely broken can become both the strongest and most beautiful aspects of our being.

She is the author of more than twenty other science books for children.Grade 3-8-- A basic introduction to math concepts. VanCleave's approach may seem a bit formal and textbook-like, but the actual content is fun and inviting. She divides the text into four broad categories: basics, which includes discussion of fractions, averages, equivalants and multiples; measurements; graphing; and geometry. Each section is systematically set up to state the objective or purpose; define facts or explain terms; present problems to solve; provide step-by-step solutions; give exercises to practice the concept; suggest an activity to apply the new skill; and supply answers to the exercises. All of the terms in the glossary are printed in boldface in the text. Activities show readers how to make $5 billion in 30 days, to create a glob solution like silly putty, to assemble and use a trundle wheel, or to graph Girl Scout cookie sales. Most sections include a "Did you know?" with amazing facts based on the principle explained. The format lends itself to individualized work from start to finish.

As such he is a fixed part of an eternal round of lavish parties, intrigues, traditions and fashions at the cold, decadent heart of Edwardian high society. Everyone knows the role Sebastian must play, but Sebastian isn't sure he wants the part. His sister Viola, meanwhile, scorns every part of her inheritance and is searching for a way out. The brave new world of the twentieth--century offers both escape and destruction.</p><p>Sebastian and Viola are children of the English aristocracy. Handsome and moody, nineteen&#x2013;year&#x2013;old Sebastian is heir to Chevron, a vast country estate. Tying him to his inheritance is a deep sense of tradition and love of the English countryside, but he loathes the cold, extravagant society of which he is a part. At sixteen, his sister Viola is more independent: an unfashionable beauty who scorns every part of her inheritance&#x2014;most particularly that of womanhood. It is July 1905, and Chevron is once again the site of a lavish house party. The guests include the great beauty Lady Rochampton and the explorer Leonard Anquetil. It is Lady Rochampton who will initiate Sebastian in the art of love, but it is Anquetil who opens for both brother and sister the gateway to another world. Vita Sackville&#x2013;West was a distinguished novelist, poet, and critic. She lived with her husband, Harold Nicolson, at Sissinghurst in Kent. The couple was the subject of the acclaimed BBC series <i>Portrait of a Marriage.</i>VICTORIA SACKVILLE-WEST, known as Vita, was born in 1892 at Knole in Kent, the only child of aristocratic parents. In 1913 she married diplomat Harold Nicolson, with whom she had two sons and travelled extensively before settling at Kent's Sissinghurst Castle in 1930, where she devoted much of her time to creating its now world famous garden. Throughout her life Sackville-West had a number of other relationships with both men and women, and her unconventional marriage would later become the subject of a biography written by her son Nigel Nicolson. Though she produced a substantial body of work, amongst which are writings on travel and gardening, Sackville-West is best known for her novels&nbsp;<i>The Edwardians</i>&nbsp;(1930) and&nbsp;<i>All Passion Spent&nbsp;</i>(1931), and for the pastoral poem&nbsp;<i>The Land&nbsp;</i>(1926), which was awarded the prestigious Hawthornden Prize.

The Soviet Union's demise and Russia's ensuing troubles have led many to wonder. But this is to look through a skewed prism indeed. In this provocative and elegantly written short history of Russia, Marshall Poe takes us well beyond the Soviet haze deep into the nation's fascinating--not at all inevitable, and in key respects remarkably successful--past.</p><br><p> Tracing Russia's course from its beginnings to the present day, Poe shows that Russia was the only non-Western power to defend itself against Western imperialism for centuries. It did so by building a powerful state that molded society to its military needs. Thus arose the only non-Western path to modern society--a unique path neither "European" nor "Asian" but, most aptly, "Russian."</p><br><p> From the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, Russia prevailed despite unparalleled onslaughts by powerful Western armies. However, while Europe nurtured limited government, capitalism, and scientific and cultural revolution, early Russian society cultivated autocracy and command economics. Both Europe and Russia eventually created modern infrastructures, but the European model proved more productive and powerful. The post-World War I communist era can be seen as a natural continuation of Russia's autocratic past that, despite its tragic turns, kept Russia globally competitive for decades.</p><br><p> The Russian moment in world history thus began with its first confrontations with Europe in the fifteenth century, and ended in 1991 with the Soviet collapse. Written with verve and great insight, <i>The Russian Moment in World History</i> will be widely read and vigorously debated by those who seek a clear and unequivocal understanding of the complex history that has made Russia what it is today.</p></p><p><p>"This unique, interesting, and stimulating book shoehorns the whole of Russian history into a single long essay, one that is argued very forcefully and written with remarkable clarity and verve."<b>--Reginald Zelnik, University of California, Berkeley, author of <i>Law and Disorder on the Narova River</i></b></p><p>"This is a stimulating and timely essay, which, as intended, is provocative and potentially controversial at every turn."<b>--Simon Franklin, Clare College, University of Cambridge, coauthor of <i>The Emergence of Rus' 750-1200</i></b></p><b>Marshall T.

I spotted a parking space in front of our <br>destination, a caf� where we dined frequently, sharing chowder, fried clams, <br>gigantic iced teas, and dreams of the future.<br> I told my husband, "Look, there"s a parking space. Not only that &#x2014;<br> there"s money in the meter."<br> "I"m glad," he murmured, seeking my eyes through his <br>sunglasses. "But I think my meter is running out."<br> His metaphor fell on deaf ears. With a new life growing inside <br>me &#x2014; our fourth child &#x2014; I may have been unwilling to accept his meaning.<br> At the time my husband"s lapses in memory seemed innocuous. <br>He might forget a neighbor"s name or neglect to stop at the store or forget <br>where the ignition was in the car, but I was clever at disregarding the hints of <br>medical illness. After all, he frequently drove different cars as part of his <br>advertising business, and he was so busy; keeping up with minor details was <br>too much to expect. The situation will improve when we move into a new <br>house, I told myself, or when the children are older, or when someone in the <br>medical community will listen to what I am saying.<br> We moved, the children grew, and the improvement never <br>happened. We were near financial ruin. Customers weren"t calling us back; <br>new jobs weren"t coming our way. He had ever greater difficulty focusing and <br>organizing his thoughts, sometimes rewriting ad copy he had finished the day <br>before. Once so gentle, docile, and fun to be around, he became frustrated <br>and angry. My mantra continued whenever I was awake: "Things will be so <br>much better when &#x2014;" When?<br> Our journey into the world of dementia began in 1971, when no <br>guideposts, advocates, manuals, or support groups were available to help us. <br>The National Alzheimer"s Association would not be organized for another <br>decade. My husband was only in his forties, and I did not believe that his <br>forgetfulness was a natural part of aging. The children chided their father <br>occasionally about his "absent-mindedness" but seemed to see nothing <br>deeper. The prescription for Valium to treat his supposed "depression" was <br>refilled many times. And sometimes my husband unwittingly doubled the <br>dose or forgot to take it at all.<br> Always well dressed in the past, my handsome, athletic husband <br>began to need help matching his suit, tie, and shirt. I started to lay out his <br>clothes for the next day before we went to bed at night. I made sure to tell <br>him what fun I had selecting the outfits, but I was embarrassed to be doing <br>this task. I never mentioned it to others.<br> Then in 1973, a major stroke paralyzed him on one side, and I <br>replaced the Brooks Brothers suits with sweatsuits, which he soon stained <br>with food. The stroke took away his language ability, transforming a man who <br>had made his living through eloquent writing into someone who had to rely <br>entirely on words of one syllable. Neurologists and physical therapists told <br>me not to expect any improvements in his speech though he did learn to <br>walk again, ever so slowly, with a leg brace and a walker. Life was very hard <br>for all of us, but it was especially horrible for my husband. He became <br>frustrated beyond comprehension.<br> At times he did not seem to recognize our children or me. <br>Sometimes he appeared thoroughly perplexed about our home. I remember <br>him angrily rattling the doorknob in an effort to go outside but not being able <br>to open the door. And yet I also recall his having enough of his former self <br>that when he looked at our young baby, tears would run down his face.<br> His abilities continued to decline. As soon as I became the least <br>bit comfortable with his current condition, he would take another step in the <br>downhill progression of dementia. I felt completely overwhelmed. At times I <br>was diapering both our youngest child and my husband. There"s no way I can <br>do this, I would think to myself.<br> Finally things came to a head. My husband kept opening the door <br>to go outside &#x2014; as if to escape from what was happening to him &#x2014; and my <br>toddler would follow him out. Soon our son started trying to open the door <br>and walk out on his own (this was before safety devices were so readily <br>available). I realized I had to act &#x2014; proactively, positively, and immediately, <br>before my husband and son left home and got lost. I installed a new handle <br>higher on the door, leaving the old knob intact but disabled. My son could no <br>longer reach the door. More incredibly to me, my husband didn"t understand <br>the concept of the new handle: he would repeatedly go over to the door, try <br>the old knob, and think that the door was broken.<br> This tiny event made me realize that I could make some changes <br>in the way we were living. I could stop walking on eggshells, in fear of what <br>would happen next, and start making a positive difference in our surroundings <br>and in my approach to his illness. I"m a very competitive person, and I started <br>thinking of the entire situation as a game &#x2014; a brand-new game I wanted to <br>win. I knew I had to get suited up and be ready to play. Each daily task &#x2014; <br>eating, dressing, toileting, everything &#x2014; was a new inning, a new round in <br>this game.<br> I stopped making excuses for the changes in his behavior and the <br>decline in his cognitive functions. The neurologist had told me that my <br>husband"s disease was progressive and would be fatal &#x2014; and in an odd way, <br>that knowledge helped me. It gave me the energy I needed to cope with what <br>he and I both faced, because I knew that the situation would not go on forever.<br> I vowed to learn to live with this person who was inhabiting the <br>body of the man I cherished. I had to detach myself emotionally from the man <br>my husband used to be and live now with the man he had become. The task <br>at hand &#x2014; this minute, and every minute of every day &#x2014; was to ensure my <br>family"s survival; I couldn"t waste time focusing on my lot in life. I had to deal <br>with the reality of today.<br> I decided not to heed the hospital social workers who told me that <br>my husband would be "fine" if he went to live at an institution for the mentally <br>ill or at a nursing home for the elderly, where he would be with others <br>suffering from dementia. In that era, I did not trust that hospital and nursing-<br>home workers would try to connect with him. And I knew that if he stayed at <br>home, I could still reach parts of this man. A great deal of the time, his <br>emotions seemed akin to mine. If I can reach him on an emotional level, I <br>thought, instead of on a verbal or cognitive one, maybe life can be less <br>threatening and frustrating for him.<br> I started a two-part list of issues related to his illness. Those <br>elements that I thought could be changed, ameliorated, or implemented I put <br>in part one. The elements that no amount of concentrated effort could ever <br>change I listed in part two. I wrote "improved mobility" on the first list, while I <br>relegated "return of speech" to the second. I placed "daily laughter" on the list <br>of goals that could be implemented and "planting the garden" on the list of <br>those that could not. Eventually my lists filled a spiral-bound notebook, with <br>several hundred entries.<br> After putting into practice the ideas and goals on the first list, I <br>found that a smile from my husband, calmness in our household, meant a <br>win for all of us. I wanted to laugh at the end of the day, not curl up in a <br>corner or break down in despair.<br> From the items in my notebook I developed five simple tenets, <br>which I now teach to people who care for patients with Alzheimer"s disease <br>or related forms of progressive dementia such as vascular dementia, Pick"s <br>disease, and Lewybody disease. These ideas are the basis for the <br>humanistic approach to caring that I call "habilitation." The literal meaning of <br>habilitate is "to clothe or dress," but I use it in the sense of "to make <br>capable," which is actually an older meaning of the word. A habilitated person <br>with dementia can live using his or her upper limits of function, intellect, <br>emotion, and spirit. Using the tenets of habilitation, both patients and care <br>partners can feel successful at what they do, rather than feeling constantly <br>weighted down. (I prefer the terms "care partner" or "habilitator" to "caregiver," <br>which assumes less involvement on the part of the patient.)<br> The following are the tenets that I developed, first for my own use <br>at home and later for the use of other patients with dementias.<br><br>1. Make the Physical Environment Work. Simplify the environment. <br>Accommodate perceptual loss by eliminating distractions.<br><br>2. Know That Communication Remains Possible. Remember that the <br>emotion behind failing words is far more important than the words themselves <br>and needs to be validated. Although many losses occur with this disease, <br>assume that the patient can still register feelings that matter.<br><br>3. Focus Only on Remaining Skills. Value what abilities remain. Help the <br>patient compensate for any lost abilities without bringing them to his or her <br>attention.<br><br>4. Live in the Patient"s World. Never question, chastise, or try to reason with <br>the patient. Join her in her current "place" or time, wherever that may be, and <br>find joy with her there.<br><br>5. Enrich the Patient"s Life. Create moments for success; eliminate possible <br>moments of failure, and praise frequently and with sincerity. Attempt to find <br>humor wherever possible.<br><br> These tenets require continuous examination of how the patient <br>thinks, feels, communicates, compensates, and responds to change, <br>emotion, and love. Improving understanding in these areas can lead to the <br>biggest successes in treatment.<br> Along with my direct experience, my decades of work with <br>professional and family care partners have shown that the habilitation <br>approach works. Having worked with thousands of patients and care partners <br>over the years, I have come to know that even people with fatal neurological <br>illnesses still possess the innate drive to maximize their potential. After <br>observing the success of the habilitation approach, colleagues and friends <br>began to study and implement the tenets themselves, easing the burden of <br>care partners, developing activities for Alzheimer"s patients, studying those in <br>long-term care, and addressing their special architectural and interior design <br>needs. All of these researchers from varying disciplines have long believed in <br>and studied the innate drive that remains in people with neurological diseases <br>such as Alzheimer"s. This shared belief has led to a clearer understanding of <br>why we should continue to focus on patients" positive aspects and remaining <br>skills.<br> During the years I care partnered with my husband, I clarified the <br>tenets, and both he and I were able to succeed at living under our changed <br>circumstances. When he died in 1976, I moved back to my parents" home <br>with our four children, whose ages ranged from four to sixteen. I had told my <br>parents that I wanted to stay with them just for a few weeks to figure out what <br>I should do with the rest of my life; instead I stayed for fifteen years. The <br>children grew up, and I bandaged cut fingers and injured spirits. They <br>participated in Pop Warner football, Little League baseball, high school <br>soccer, track, and championship swimming. They found friendship and love <br>and went on to colleges and careers. Now that they are enriching the lives of <br>others, I often wonder how they would have matured without the years of <br>turmoil and distress, fear of the unknown, and terror of the known that they <br>endured. Perhaps support and love for all of our family &#x2014; my husband <br>included &#x2014; offset family tragedy.<br> After moving in with my parents, I immediately began working as a <br>nursing assistant in a nursing home run by a local hospital. I soon became <br>director of restorative services, which let me initiate a program to try to help <br>several residents who had progressive dementias &#x2014; and who at that time <br>bore such lofty diagnoses as "organic" and "chronic" brain syndrome. Before <br>long, newly admitted people wanted to be included in the program, which was <br>based on the habilitative tenets described above. I led daily sessions with the <br>patients, worked with the care partners at the facility, and developed a <br>support group for spouses. I have been leading such groups continually since <br>1978, and this work remains a great joy in my life.<br> The nursing home developed a special-care unit for the patients in <br>the program, and soon we recognized that they were doing much better <br>cognitively than they had done before and were participating more fully in <br>daily living activities, such as dressing and bathing. All of the patients <br>appeared calmer, which meant that their medications could be reduced. In <br>this unit, restraints were removed; hugs were instituted.<br> After successfully mentoring the staff and performing daily <br>cognitive and supportive interactions with a population that grew to comprise <br>more than half of the patient roster at the facility, I attempted to have this new <br>kind of care &#x2014; the habilitative approach &#x2014; recognized by state and national <br>regulatory agencies concerned with confidentiality and the right to a private <br>diagnosis. But in the 1970s, civil libertarians and others were loath to have <br>specific beds set aside for patients with dementias. They were concerned <br>that such groupings would reveal the patients" diagnoses, which would be an <br>invasion of privacy.<br> I was very lonely during that time. I had no one to talk to about <br>changing the scene for cognitively impaired adults. Alzheimer"s was <br>beginning to be given as a diagnosis, even though it was treated as a brand-<br>new discovery; but except for a few colleagues at the nursing home, no one <br>was willing to listen to my ideas. I was so elated when I discovered John <br>Panella at Cornell University, who was studying the impact of special <br>programming on patients with Alzheimer"s disease at a day care facility in <br>White Plains, New York. At last I had discovered someone else who believed <br>that we could make a difference in the lives of Alzheimer"s patients.<br> The establishment in 1980 of the National Alzheimer"s <br>Association gave me and the growing number of concerned individuals and <br>organizations renewed courage to fight for specialized housing and <br>programming. By 1981 the program at the nursing home where I worked <br>became an officially sanctioned special unit. As attempts to duplicate it <br>popped up all over the Northeast, I became happily busy teaching and <br>mentoring.<br> During the next two decades, the National Alzheimer"s <br>Association grew, with branches in every state offering family support and <br>patient care, professional education, research opportunities, and advocacy. <br>And as other professionals became interested in the care of people with <br>Alzheimer"s, the effort to institute habilitative settings became easier. <br>Advocates traveled to state houses and government agencies to describe the <br>major differences tha...</p><h2>Oxford Latin Reader: Teacher&#39;s Book (Oxford Latin Course)</h2><p>This second edition of the Oxford Latin Course combines the best features of both modern and traditional methods of Latin teaching from first stages to GCSE.

We now have access to a glut of larger-than-life objects, from candy to pornography to atomic weapons&#x2015;that gratify these gut instincts with often-dangerous results. Animal biologists coined the term &#x201c;supernormal stimuli&#x201d; to describe imitations that appeal to primitive instincts and exert a stronger pull than real things, such as soccer balls that geese prefer over eggs. Evolutionary psychologist Deirdre Barrett applies this concept to the alarming disconnect between human instinct and our created environment, demonstrating how supernormal stimuli are a major cause of today&#x2019;s most pressing problems, including obesity and war. However, Barrett does more than show how unfettered instincts fuel dangerous excesses. She also reminds us that by exercising self-control we can rein them in, potentially saving ourselves and civilization. 55 illustrations</p><p>Deirdre Barrett is an evolutionary psychologist at Harvard Medical School&#x2019;s Behavioral Medicine Program.

She finally took on this formidable task late in her career, but her untimely death left most of the work unpublished. Now <i>Redeeming American Political Thought</i> makes these essays, some published here for the first time, available to readers.<br> <br> In these thirteen essays, Shklar explores two themes crucial to discussions of American democracy: first, what she terms the "fundamental social condition" of American life, the tension between expansive political equality and persistent social inequality; and second, "redeeming" American political thought for those who believe it lacks the complexity and depth of the European tradition. She covers issues ranging from the use of history in political discourse to the effect of skepticism on politics and thinkers from Hamilton and Jefferson to Melville. The strength and depth of this collection underscore Shklar's reputation as one of this century's most important liberal scholars.<br> <br> Judith N. Shklar (1928-1992) was Cowles Professor of Government at Harvard University and the author of nine books in political philosophy.</p></p><p>This posthumous collection of essays doesn't work well as a book but is worth reading anyway. Shklar's (Ordinary Vices, 1984, etc.) untimely death in 1992 left a hole in Harvard's political-science department and a project on American political thought unfinished. Two colleagues attempt to address the latter in this volume by presenting 13 of her essays on the subject, only four of which have previously appeared. While the serious, impressive scholarship characteristic of Shklar's work is evident here, however, the result is more frustrating than illuminating. Writing about American political thought has always been problematic: Without great philosophical works to serve as touchstones, scholars are confronted with a wide variety of source material to blend together into a coherent theory. Shklar quite rightly rejects the traditional oversimplifications of consensualism (Americans are all basically liberals) and exceptionalism (American political experience is unique) that have been used to obscure the richness and diversity of American political thought. Unfortunately, her impressive forays into that richness and diversity--exploring figures from Hamilton to Hawthorne, and topics ranging from friendship to rights--yields no general framework that illuminates the whole. The veins of American intellectual history are mined selectively, at times repetitively, and with large areas left untouched. For example, while the Jefferson-Adams correspondence is indeed one of the great treasures of early American political thought, it's introduced and consulted extensively in several essays, while anything beyond a passing mention of a person or event from the postCivil War period is hard to find. Historical description rather than philosophical generalization was always Shklar's strength, but with the time to shape these essays into a book her efforts would have constituted a much more significant contribution to American political thought. It's tragic that this will not occur. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br><i>The First Amendment<br></i><br>I am a member of what I believe to be the last recognizable generation of full-time, life-time American novelists. We appear to be standing more or less in a row. It was the Great Depression which made us similarly edgy and watchful. It was World War II which lined us up so nicely, whether we were men or women, whether we were ever in uniform or not. It was an era of romantic anarchy in publishing which gave us money and mentors, willy-nilly, when we were young&#x2013;while we learned our craft. Words printed on pages were still the principal form of long-distance communication and stored information in America when we were young.<br><br>No more.<br><br>Nor are there many publishers and editors and agents left who are eager to find some way to get money and other forms of encouragement to young writers who write as clumsily as member of my literary generation did when we started out. The wild and wonderful and expensive guess was made back then that we might acquire some wisdom and learn how to write halfway decently by and by. Writers were needed that much back then.<br><br>It was an amusing and instructive time for writers&#x2013;for hundreds of them.<br><br>Television wrecked the short-story branch of the industry, and now accountants and business school graduates dominate book publishing. They feel that money spent on someone's first novel is good money down a rat hole. They are right. It almost always is.<br><br>So, as I say, I think I belong to America's last generation of novelists. Novelists will come one by one from now on, not in seeming families, and will perhaps write only one or two novels, and let it go at that. Many will have inherited or married money.<br><br>The most influential of my bunch, in my opinion, is still J. D. Salinger, although he has been silent for years. The most promising was perhaps Edward Lewis Wallant, who died so young. And it is my thinking about the death of James Jones two years ago, who was not all that young, who was almost exactly my age, which accounts for the autumnal mood of this book. There have been other reminders of my own mortality, to be sure, but the death of Jones is central&#x2013;perhaps because I see his widow Gloria so often and because he, too, was a self-educated midwesterner, and because he, too, in a major adventure for all of us, which was the Second World War, had been an enlisted man. And let it here be noted that the best-known members of my literary generation, if they wrote about war, almost unanimously despised officers and made heroes of sketchily educated, aggressively unaristocratic enlisted men.<br><br>� � �<br><br>James Jones told me one time that his publisher and Ernest Hemingway's, Charles Scribner's Sons, had once hoped to get Jones and Hemingway together&#x2013;so that they could enjoy each other's company as old warriors.<br><br>Jones declined, by his own account, because he did not regard Hemingway as a fellow soldier. He said Hemingway in wartime was free to come and go from the fighting as he pleased, and to take time off for a fine meal or woman or whatever. Real soldiers, according to Jones, damn well had to stay where they were told, or go where they were told, and eat swill, and take the worst the enemy had to throw at them day after day, week after week.<br><br>� � �<br><br>It may be that the most striking thing about members of my literary generation in retrospect will be that we were allowed to say absolutely anything without fear of punishment. Our American heirs may find it incredible, as most foreigners do right now, that a nation would want to enforce as a law something which sounds more like a dream, which reads as follows:<br><br>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<br><br>How could a nation with such a law raise its children in an atmosphere of decency? It couldn't&#x2013;it can't. So the law will surely be repealed soon for the sake of children.<br><br>And even now my books, along with books by Bernard Malamud and James Dickey and Joseph Heller and many other first-rate patriots, are regularly thrown out of public-school libraries by school board members, who commonly say that they have not actually read the books, but that they have it on good authority that the books are bad for children.<br><br>� � �<br><br>My novel <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> was actually burned in a furnace by a school janitor in Drake, North Dakota, on instructions from the school committee there, and the school board made public statements about the unwholesomeness of the book. Even by the standards of Queen Victoria, the only offensive line in th entire novel is this: "Get out of the road, you dumb motherfucker." This is spoken by an American antitank gunner to an unarmed American chaplain's assistant during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe in December 1944, the largest single defeat of American arms (the Confederacy excluded) in history. The chaplain's assistant had attracted enemy fire.<br><br>So on November 16, 1973, I wrote as follows to Charles McCarthy of Drake, North Dakota:<br><br>Dear Mr. McCarthy:<br><br>I am writing to you in your capacity as chairman of the Drake School Board. I am among those American writers whose books have been destroyed in the now famous furnace of your school.<br><br>Certain members of your community have suggested that my work is evil. This is extraordinarily insulting to me. The news from Drake indicates to me that books and writers are very unreal to you people. I am writing this letter to let you know how real I am.<br><br>I want you to know, too, that my publisher and I have done absolutely nothing to exploit the disgusting news from Drake. We are not clapping each other on the back, crowing about all the books we will sell because of the news. We have declined to go on television, have written no fiery letters to editorial pages, have granted no lengthy interviews. We are angered and sickened and saddened. And no copies of this letter have been sent to anybody else. You now hold the only copy in your hands. It is a strictly private letter from me to the people of Drake, who have done so much to damage my reputation in the eyes of their children and then in the eyes of the world. Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?<br><br>I gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.<br><br>If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don't damage children much. They didn't damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.<br><br>After I have said all this. I am sure you are still ready to respond, in effect, "Yes, yes&#x2013;but it still remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community." This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.<br><br>I read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can't stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.<br><br>If you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the eduction of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books&#x2013;books you hadn't even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.<br><br>Again: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br><br>That was seven years ago. There has so far been no reply. At this very moment, as I write in New York City, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> has been banned from school libraries not fifty miles from here. A legal battle begun several years ago rages on. The school board in question has found lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment tooth and nail. There is never a shortage anywhere of lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment, as though it were nothing more than a clause in a lease from a crooked slumlord.<br><br>At the start of that particular litigation, on March 24th of 1976, I wrote a comment for the Op-Ed page of the Long Island edition of <i>The New York Times</i>. It went like this:<br><br>A school board has denounced some books again&#x2013;out in Levittown this time. One of the books was mine. I hear about un-American nonsense like this twice a year or so. One time out in North Dakota, the books were actually burned in a furnace. I had a laugh. It was such an ignorant, dumb, superstitious thing to do.<br><br>It was so cowardly, too&#x2013;to make a great show of attacking artifacts. It was like St. George attacking bedspreads and cuckoo clocks.<br><br>Yes, and St. Georges like that seem to get elected or appointed to school committees all the time. They are actually proud of their illiteracry. They imagine that they are somehow celebrating the bicentennial when they boast, as some did in Levittown, that they hadn't actually read the books they banned.<br><br>Such lunks are often the backbone of volunteer fire departments and the United States Infantry and cake sales and so on, and they have been thanked often enough for that. But they have no business supervising the eductions of children in a free society. They are just too bloody stupid.<br><br>Here is how I propose to end book-banning in this country once and for all: Every candidate for school committee should be hooked up to a lie-detector and asked this question: "Have you read a book from start to finish since high school? Or did you even read a book from start to finish in high school?"<br><br>If the truthful answer is "no," then the candidate should be told politely that he cannot get on the school committee and blow off his big bazoo about how books make children crazy.<br><br>Whenever ideas are squashed in this country, literate lovers of the American experiment write careful and intricate explanations of why all ideas must be allowed to live. It is time for them to realize that they are attempting to explain America at its bravest and most optimistic to orangutans.<br><br>From now on, I intend to limit my discourse with dimwitted Savonarolas to this advice: "Have somebody read the First Amendment to the United States Constitution out loud to you, you God damned fool!"<br><br>Well&#x2013;the American Civil Liberties Union or somebody like that will come to the scene of trouble, as they always do. They will explain what is in the Constitution, and to whom it applies.<br><br>They will win.<br><br>And there will be millions who are bewildered and heartbroken by the legal victory, who think some things should never be said&#x2013;especially about religion.<br><br>They are in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>Hi ho.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br><br>Why is it so ordinary for American citizens to show such scorn for the First Amendment? I discussed that some at a fund raiser for the American Civil Liberties Union at Sands Point, New York, out on Long Island, on September 16, 1979. The house where I spoke, incidentally, was said to be the model for Gatsby's house in F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. I saw no reason to doubt the claim.<br><br>I said this in such a setting:<br><br>"I will not speak directly to the ejection of my book <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> from the school libraries of Island Trees. I have a vested interest. I wrote the book, after all, so why wouldn&#x2019;t I argue that it is less repulsive than the school board says?<br><br>"I will speak of Thomas Aquinas instead. I will tell you my dim memories of what he said about the hierarchy of laws on this planet, which was flat at the time. The highest law, he said, was divine law, God's law. Beneath that was natural law, which I suppose would include thunderstorms, and our right to shield our children from poisonous ideas, and so on.<br><br>"And the lowest law was human law.<br><br>"Let me clarify this scheme by comparing its parts to playing cards. Enemies of the Bill of Rights do the same sort of thing all the time, so why shouldn't we? Divine law, then, is an ace. Natural law is a king. The Bill of Rights is a lousy queen.<br><br>"The Thomist hierarchy of laws is so far from being ridiculous that I have never met anybody who did not believe in it right down to the marrow of his or her bones. Everybody knows that there are laws with more grandeur than those which are printed in our statute books. The big trouble is that there is so little agreement as to how those grander laws are worded. Theologians can give us hints of the wording, but it takes a dictator to set them down just right&#x2013;to dot the <i>i</i>'s and cross the <i>t</i>'s. A man who had been a mere corporal in the army did that for Germany and then for all of Europe, you may remember, not long ago. There was nothing he did not know about divine and natural law. He had fistfuls of aces and kings to play.<br><br>"Meanwhile, over on this side of the Atlantic, we were not playing with a full deck, as they say. Because of our Constitution, the highest card anybody had to play was a lousy queen, contemptible human law. That remains true today. I myself cel...</p><h2>The Inner Quarters: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period</h2><p>The Sung Dynasty (960-1279) was a paradoxical era for Chinese women. This was a time when footbinding spread, and Confucian scholars began to insist that it was better for a widow to starve than to remarry. Yet there were also improvements in women's status in marriage and property rights. In this thoroughly original work, one of the most respected scholars of premodern China brings to life what it was like to be a woman in Sung times, from having a marriage arranged, serving parents-in-law, rearing children, and coping with concubines, to deciding what to do if widowed.<br><br>Focusing on marriage, Patricia Buckley Ebrey views family life from the perspective of women. She argues that the ideas, attitudes, and practices that constituted marriage shaped women's lives, providing the context in which they could interpret the opportunities open to them, negotiate their relationships with others, and accommodate or resist those around them.<br><br>Ebrey questions whether women's situations actually deteriorated in the Sung, linking their experiences to widespread social, political, economic, and cultural changes of this period. She draws from advice books, biographies, government documents, and medical treatises to show that although the family continued to be patrilineal and patriarchal, women found ways to exert their power and authority. No other book explores the history of women in pre-twentieth-century China with such energy and depth.</p><p>"Opening up questions about women's lives, about gender, about why we read history at all and how we write it, Patricia Buckley Ebrey has made The Inner Quarters<i> a place we need to enter."&#x2015;from the Foreword</i><b>Patricia Buckley Ebrey</b> is Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of Illinois, Urbana, and the author of <i>Confucianism and Family Rituals in Imperial China</i> (1991).</p><h2>Elementary Korean Workbook</h2><p>Includes Audio CD.<br><br>The <i>Elementary Korean Workbook</i> is a companion volume to the new Second Edition of <i>Elementary Korean</i> by Ross King and Jaehoon Yeon, also available from Tuttle Publishing.

"In the High and Far-Off Times" when elephants sported short, "bulgy" noses, a young pachyderm full of "satiable curiosity" sets off to discover what crocodiles eat for dinner. After a rousing tug-of-war with the Crocodile himself, the Elephant's Child walks away with a new and improved (and quite sore) elongated trunk. Bolam's well-paced version of the tale is sure to perk up the ears of inquisitive listeners. Unfortunately, the text's understated action and gentle humor are overshadowed by random violence--the other animals spank the Elephant's Child whenever he asks a question, and the Elephant Child's new trunk is eventually used to spank them back. Bolam's bright, primitive paintings boldly contrast with airy white backgrounds, and the jungle animals' childlike facial expressions are particularly engaging. Ultimately, though, Kipling's writings remain too sophisticated for the picture book set. Ages 5-up. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.No, no, and, again, no! Bolam's abridgements are pointless; her changes are foolish vandalism. Her shortened version is no easier than Kipling's ``best beloved'' classic; she omits the ostrich and--outrageously--the bicolored python rock snake, as well as the Elephant's Child's delightful itinerary and most of the richly deserved spankings he finally administers to his aunts and uncles; what's left is not so much less challenging as less fun in the absence of the whole. Worse, and quite gratuitously, the baboon uncle has become a lion. Kipling's story is not a folk tale; it's a masterpiece whose glory is its language, and children as young as four have enjoyed it for almost a century. There is no excuse for tampering with it. (Incidentally, this is Bolam's debut, and she looks like a promising illustrator: vigorous bold line and vibrant, sophisticated colors in collage- like blocks.) (Picture book.

Paul examines the 'image' of women which arise in a number of Buddhist texts associated with Mahayana and finds that, while ideally the tradition purports to be egalitarian, in actual practice it often betrayed a strong misogynist prejudice. Sanskrit and Chinese texts are organized by theme and type, progressing from those which treat the traditionally orthodox and negative to those which set forth a positive consideration of soteriological paths for women. . . . In <i>Women in Buddhism,</i> Diana Paul may be forcing our consideration of the problem of female enlightenment.

Originally based on the author&#39;s lecture courses at Cambridge University, it is intended primarily for undergraduates, but, due to its comprehensive nature, it is a very useful reference text for research workers in many branches of astronomy and space physics. The author considers the night sky as the celestial sphere and powerfully exploits the methods of spherical geometry. Most problems in which the precise determination of a heavenly body&#39;s position in the sky is important are considered in theoretical detail, and the necessary formulae are derived to a precision that is sufficient for all but the most specialist purposes. The present revision has ensured that the terminology and treatment correspond precisely to current astronomical practice. A guiding principle has been to re-establish compatibility with the Astronomical Ephemeris and, to a lesser extent, with the fuller explanations of the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. Fairly frequent comments added to the text indicate the sometimes modified relevance of the subject matter to modern astronomy. A number of additional exercises help to illustrate the new material.</p><p>This new revision of a standard work gives a general but comprehensive introduction to positional astronomy.

The first flower books were intended as medicinal guides, or else illustrated volumes that catalogued the elaborate and extensive gardens of the well-to-do. But when Carl Linnaeus first classified the plant kingdom in 1735, the botanical book quickly took on a more scientific cast. By the nineteenth century, the flourishing of botanical publications reflected both the rapid rise of gardening as an amateur hobby and the desire of artists and decorators for new visual resources. <i>Gardens in Perpetual Bloom: Botanical Illustration in Europe and America 1600&#x2013;1850</i> traces the appreciation of flowers and their depiction, from the studious world of monks and princes to the era of the gardening enthusiast. The book's 110 prints and drawings&#x2015;which include masterful engravings by Georg Dionysus Ehret, the eighteenth century's most accomplished botanical artist, and hand-colored prints by Pierre-Joseph Redout�, the premier draftsman of flowers for Marie Antoinette and Josephine Bonaparte&#x2015;are remarkable for their technical virtuosity, delicate tonalities, scientific accuracy and seemingly infinite variety. <i>Gardens in Perpetual Bloom</i> is both a valuable historical survey and an affordable, attractively designed volume of jewel-like beauty.</p><p></p><h2>EFT for the Highly Sensitive Temperament</h2><p>Are you very sensitive to your own feelings and the feelings of those around you?

After a devastating financial crisis, furious voters sent a new breed of politician to Washington. These young Republican firebrands, led by "Fighting Bob" La Follette of Wisconsin, vowed to overthrow the party leaders and purge Wall Street's corrupting influence from Washington. Their opponents called them "radicals," and "fanatics." They called themselves <i>Progressives</i>.</p><p>President Theodore Roosevelt disapproved of La Follette's confrontational methods. Fearful of splitting the party, he compromised with the conservative House Speaker, "Uncle Joe" Cannon, to pass modest reforms. But as La Follette's crusade gathered momentum, the country polarized, and the middle ground melted away. Three years after the end of his presidency, Roosevelt embraced La Follette's militant tactics and went to war against the Republican establishment, bringing him face to face with his handpicked successor, William Taft. Their epic battle shattered the Republican Party and permanently realigned the electorate, dividing the country into two camps: Progressive and Conservative.</p><p><i>Unreasonable Men</i> takes us into the heart of the epic power struggle that created the progressive movement and defined modern American politics. Recounting the fateful clash between the pragmatic Roosevelt and the radical La Follette, Wolraich's riveting narrative reveals how a few Republican insurgents broke the conservative chokehold on Congress and initiated the greatest period of political change in America's history.</p></p><p><p>Michael Wolraich is a political journalist and historian, author of <i>Blowing Smoke</i>, and co-founder of the political blog dagblog.com.

Edsall, Joseph Pulitzer II and Edith Pulitzer Moore Professor, Columbia Graduate School of Journalism</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a fascinating, thoroughly readable account of the rise of Progressivism in America, with a detailed portrait of the rivalry between the two giants of that movement, Teddy Roosevelt and Fighting Bob La Follette. It's a great addition to the history of the period, and it sheds some crucial light on our current moment.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Matthew Rothschild, senior editor at The Progressive</i></p><p>&#x201c;Unreasonable Men is a shrewd and vividly written account of a conflict that defined the politics of the Progressive Era. It is also a timely story: the same argument between foes and defenders of corporate power which raged a century ago can be heard in our partisan battles today.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Kazin, Professor of History at Georgetown University, editor of Dissent and author of American Dreamers: How the Left Shaped a Nation</i></p><p>&#x201c;Unreasonable Men recounts the nation's dramatic transformation as political focus shifted from promoting the interests of the wealthiest Americans to protecting its everyday citizens. Wolraich's engaging narrative recaptures the excitement and suspense of the nation's turn from conservatism to progressivism. For a nation facing a similar crisis over the role of government today, this book offers inspiration and illustrates the power of fearless leaders committed to real change for the betterment of all.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nancy C. Unger, Professor of History at Santa Clara University and author of Fighting Bob La Follette: The Righteous Reformer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Michael Wolraich has that special ability to be immersed in the present and bring its insights to the past while still accepting, understanding it on its own terms. Here he brings to life the century old battle where progressive reformism emerged paradoxically out of a civil war within the GOP. A must read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Josh Marshall, Editor and Publisher of Talking Points Memo, Polk Award winner</i></p></p><h2>The Weight of the World: Social Suffering in Contemporary Society</h2><p>Confined in their governmental ivory towers, their actions largely dictated by public opinion polls, politicians and state officials are all too often oblivious to the everyday lives of ordinary citizens. These persons, who often experience so much hardship in their lives, have few ways to make themselves heard and are obliged either to protest outside official frameworks or remain locked in the silence of their despair. Under the direction of Pierre Bourdieu, France&#x2019;s foremost sociologist, a team of 22 researchers spent three years studying and analyzing the new forces of social suffering that characterize contemporary societies&#x2014;the daily suffering of those denied the means of acquiring a socially dignified existence and of those poorly adjusted to the rapidly changing conditions of their lives. Social workers, teachers, policemen, factory workers, white-collar clerks, farmers, artisans, shopkeepers&#x2014;no one seems to be immune from the frustrations of today&#x2019;s life, not to speak of the institutions of the family, work, and education. The book can be read like a series of short stories, which include: a steel worker who was laid off after 20 years and now struggles to support his family on unemployment benefits and a part-time job; a trade unionist who finds his goals undermined by the changing nature of work; a family from Algeria living in a housing tract on the outskirts of Paris who must cope with pervasive forms of racism; and a schoolteacher confronted with urban violence. Reading these stories enables one to register these people&#x2019;s lives and the forms of social suffering that infuse them. The original publication of this book was a major social and political event in France, where it topped the best-seller list and triggered a widespread public debate on inequality, politics, and civic solidarity. It offers not only a distinctive method for analyzing social life, but another way of practicing politics.</p><p>Pierre Bourdieu is Professor of Sociology at the College de France and Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Merriam-Webster&#39;s Compact 5-Language Visual Dictionary (English, Spanish, French, German and Italian Edition)</h2><p><p>This portable visual inventory of today's world lists thousands of words and concepts in five different languages: English, Spanish, French, German and Italian.</p><p></p> <p>Chapters and corresponding themes include: the universe and Earth, the animal kingdom, sports and games, science and energy, games, plants and gardening, arts, architecture and much more.</p><p></p> <p>2,600 highly detailed pictures illustrate the meaning of 9,500 terms.</p><p></p> <p>Perfect for work, school or college study, fun, travel, or simple browsing.</p><p></p></p><p>For more than 150 years, in print and now online, Merriam-Webster has been America&#39;s leading and most-trusted provider of language information.

The work described in these two volumes suggests that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. It is some of the most exciting work in cognitive science, unifying neural and cognitive processes in a highly computational framework, with links to artificial intelligence. Although thought and problem solving have a sequential character when viewed over a time frame of minutes or hours, the authors argue that each step in the sequence is the result of the simultaneous activity of a large number of simple computational elements, each influencing others and being influenced by them. Parallel Distributed Processing describes their work in developing a theoretical framework for describing this parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Volume 2 applies to a number of specific issues in cognitive science and neuroscience. Some chapters describe models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Others discuss the relation between parallel distributed processing models and neurophysiology or describe models that are specifically addressed to neurophysiological data. The book concludes with an epilogue noting the strengths and weaknesses of the approach and directions for the future.</p><p>This two-volume work is now considered a classic in the field. It presents the results of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) group&#39;s work in the early 1980s and provides a good overview of the earlier neural network research. The PDP approach (also known as connectionism among other things) is based on the conviction that various aspects of cognitive activity are thought of in terms of massively parallel processing. The first volume starts with the general framework and continues with an analysis of learning mechanisms and various mathematical and computational tools important in the analysis of neural networks. The chapter on backpropagation is written by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, who codiscovered the algorithm in 1986. The second volume is written with a psychological and biological emphasis. It explores the relationship of PDP to various aspects of human cognition. The book is a comprehensive research survey of its time and most of the book&#39;s results and methods are still at the foundation of the neural network field.What makes people smarter than computers? These volumes by a pioneering neurocomputing group suggest that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. They describe a new theory of cognition called connectionism that is challenging the idea of symbolic computation that has traditionally been at the center of debate in theoretical discussions about the mind.</p><h2>3-2-1 Code It! 2020 (MindTap Course List)</h2><p>Learn the keys to successful medical coding with Green&#39;s best-selling 3-2-1 CODE IT!, 2020 EDITION.

Paleontologist Dr. Scott Sampson, host of Dinosaur Train on PBS Kids, tells kids how! How do paleontologists find dinosaur bones? How do they know what dinosaurs ate or looked like? And what is paleontology, anyway? Dr. Scott tackles all these questions and more while inspiring kids to go out and make the next big dino discovery!</p><p>SCOTT D. SAMPSON is a dinosaur paleontologist, science communicator, and nonprofit executive. He serves as president and CEO of Science World at Telus World of Science in Vancouver, BC. Most of Sampson&#39;s scientific research has focused on the ecology and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs. Sampson was the primary scientific consultant and on-air host of the four-part Discovery Channel series Dinosaur Planet, and today he is known to millions of children and parents around the world as &#34;Dr. Scott the Paleontologist,&#34; host of the hit PBS Kids television series Dinosaur Train. Sampson is also the author of Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life (University of California, 2009) and How to Raise a Wild Child: The Art and Science of Falling in Love with Nature (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2015).Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Bright photos accent the colorful pages in this eye-catching overview of paleontology. Sampson, otherwise known as Dr. Scott, the host of the TV show Dinosaur Train, takes a question-and-answer approach to entice readers. "How Do You Find Fossils?," "Where Are Fossils Stored?," and "How Do Paleontologists Study Fossils?" are among the baker's dozen of queries to which Sampson replies in brief, informative, and chatty text. While he doesn't mention education requirements for paleontology careers, he does urge readers to "learn as much as you can about all kinds of science" and "to spend a lot of time out in nature." A glossary of possibly unfamiliar terms (burlap and awl among them) is appended. While the book lacks an in-depth diagram that details how to become a paleontologist, it will certainly set the feet of incipient fossil hunters on the right road to their desired goal&#x2014;and is a fun read as well. VERDICT Eye candy for the paleontological wannabe, and some serious scientific nutrition as well.&#x2014;Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</p><h2>The Life and Work of Winslow Homer</h2><p>Winslow Homer captured the power and beauty of nature in a manner uniquely his own. One of the giants of American art, he began his career as an illustrator recording the Civil War for &#39;Harper&#39;s Weekly&#39;. He soon turned to painting, and his constant search for new subject matter and his basically restless nature led him all over New England, where he delighted in everything from the seacoasts of Gloucester, Massachusetts and Prout&#39;s Neck, Maine, to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. He recorded the pleasures of childhood in small towns along the Hudson River and was enchanted by the tropical landscapes of Florida, Nassau, and Bermuda. He also made two long journeys abroad. This sumptuous volume, with its lavish illustrations, also contains the first systematic catalogue of Homer&#39;s vast oeuvre. Gordon Hendricks presents many heretofore unknown facts about the artist&#39;s life and work. Mr. Hendricks&#39;s major studies of Thomas Eakins, Eadweard Muybridge, and Albert Bierstadt have helped to give him an extraordinary grasp of knowledge about his new subject. Drawing on correspondence between Homer and his family, between artist and his various dealers, and on contemporary critical reviews of Homer&#39;s work are included in this volume, as well as many documentary photographs of the artist and his family and the various sites he painted. The first complete checklist of works by Homer in public collections in the United States, a chronology, a bibliography, and an index also serve to make this beautiful book an outstanding contribution to the understanding of American art. 440 illustrations, including 68 in full color</p><p></p><h2>The Fountainhead (Scribner Classics)</h2><p>Originally published in 1943, this classic story of a gifted architect, his struggle against conventional standards, and his violent love affair brilliantly addresses a number of universal themes. By the author of Atlas Shrugged.</p><p><i>The Fountainhead</i> has become an enduring piece of literature, more popular now than when published in 1943. On the surface, it is a story of one man, Howard Roark, and his struggles as an architect in the face of a successful rival, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. But the book addresses a number of universal themes: the strength of the individual, the tug between good and evil, the threat of fascism. The confrontation of those themes, along with the amazing stroke of Rand's writing, combine to give this book its enduring influence.Ayn Rand is the author of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. Her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, was published in 1936, followed by <i>Anthem</i>. With the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> in 1943, she achieved a spectacular and enduring success.

This fresh translation of the deceptively simple book is more literal and less idiosyncratic than its predecessors. Combining the traditional strengths of the Anchor Yale Bible series with the latest research in biblical scholarship, Schipper&#x2019;s much-needed volume will succeed Edward F. Campbell&#x2019;s 1975 edition as the go-to commentary for years to come.</p><p><b>Jeremy Schipper</b> is associate professor of the Hebrew Bible at Temple University.

The driving forces in the reception of Cazanne's art were not art critics, art historians, or even the artist himself, but rather other artists--primarily the Fauves led by Matisse, de Vlaminck, and Derain; and the Cubists including Picasso, Braque, and Lager--all of whom absorbed and elaborated on Cazanne's revolutionary ideas about color and composition. Against this background of <i>Cazannisme</i>, the book presents key works by Cazanne and younger artists in revealing juxtapositions. Readers will discover analogies and variations between the works of the "father of modern art" and those of his successors in a series of related motifs--portraits, still lifes, and landscapes. This volume is, indeed, a compact history of the icons of modern art. It offers new insight into one of modern art's most complex artists, traces the influence of Cazanne's work on a succeeding generation of 20th-century artists, and examines tendencies in Cazanne's art that paved the way for both the Fauve and Cubist movements.</p><p></p><h2>The Art of How to Train Your Dragon 2</h2><p><p>Filled with more than 300 images, the official illustrated tie-in to the second chapter of the DreamWorks Animation critically acclaimed Academy Award� nominated <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> trilogy is based on the characters in Cressida Cowell&#x2019;s bestselling series and features an introduction by the voice of Stoick the Vast, Gerard Butler.</p><p>Mirroring the style of the bestselling <em>The Art of How to Train Your Dragon</em>, this outstanding insider&#x2019;s guide introduces fans to the creative process behind the film, from the story and the characters to the visual development art and animation, to the rigging, surfacing, and lighting. <em>The Art of How to Train Your Dragon 2</em> includes more than 300 concept sketches, preliminary drawings, architectural plans, and digital artwork that reveal how teams of artists bring the Dragon and Viking worlds to life with modern cinematic energy.</p><p>Starring the voice talent of the original cast&#x2014;Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrara, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.

For example, we can penetrate deep into the interior of our planet and effectively X-ray its internal structure. With this technology comes an increased awareness of how our planet is continually changing and a fresh awareness of how fragile it is. Designed for the introductory Physical Geology course found in Geology, Earth Science, Geography, or Physical Science departments, Dynamic Earth: An Introduction to Physical Geology clearly presents Earth's dynamic geologic systems with their many interdependent and interconnected components. It provides comprehensive coverage of the two major energy systems of Earth: the plate tectonic system and the hydrologic cycle. The text fulfills the needs of professors by offering current content and a striking illustration package, while exposing students to the global view of Earth and teaching them to view the world as geologists.<br><br>The book is divided in four parts. Part I presents Earth's materials and how they are created by geologic systems. Part II discusses the hydrologic system by examining subsystems chapter by chapter. Plate tectonics is the theme of Part III, with separate chapters on divergent, transform, and convergent boundaries, as well as mantle plumes--the subsystems of the tectonic system. In Part IV, the book looks back and applies the principles learned to see how Earth's resources formed and just how different Earth is when compared with other planets. The special attention to the illustrations helps students fully experience the excitement and satisfaction of visualizing and understanding geology, making Dynamic Earth: An Introduction to Physical Geology a unique exploration into our ever-evolving planet.</p><p>Professor of Geological Sciences, Brigham Young University<br><br>(late of) Brigham Young University</p><h2>Jazz Cultures</h2><p>From its beginning, jazz has presented a contradictory social world: jazz musicians have worked diligently to erase old boundaries, but they have just as resolutely constructed new ones. David Ake's vibrant and original book considers the diverse musics and related identities that jazz communities have shaped over the course of the twentieth century, exploring the many ways in which jazz musicians and audiences experience and understand themselves, their music, their communities, and the world at large.<br><br> Writing as a professional pianist and composer, the author looks at evolving meanings, values, and ideals--as well as the sounds--that musicians, audiences, and critics carry to and from the various activities they call jazz. Among the compelling topics he discusses is the "visuality" of music: the relationship between performance demeanor and musical meaning. Focusing on pianists Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, Ake investigates the ways in which musicians' postures and attitudes influence perceptions of them as profound and serious artists. In another essay, Ake examines the musical values and ideals promulgated by college jazz education programs through a consideration of saxophonist John Coltrane. He also discusses the concept of the jazz "standard" in the 1990s and the differing sense of tradition implied in recent recordings by Wynton Marsalis and Bill Frisell.<br><br> <i>Jazz Cultures</i> shows how jazz history has not consisted simply of a smoothly evolving series of musical styles, but rather an array of individuals and communities engaging with disparate--and oftentimes conflicting--actions, ideals, and attitudes.</p><p>"Ake blends careful historical research with intelligent textual criticism and sophisticated cultural theory. . . His critiques augment and enhance our understanding and appreciation of great artistry, but they do much more. This is new, imaginative, original, and generative work. There are very few people who can write about both music theory and social theory with such clarity, depth, and insight."&#x2015;George Lipsitz, author of <i>Dangerous Crossroads: Popular Music, Postmodernism and the Poetics of Place</i><br><br>"David Ake is a jazz artist who has woodshedded with his critical theory as much as with his instrument. As an astute commentator on a wide range of jazz subjects, he has the virtuosity of an Art Tatum and the eclecticism of a John Zorn."&#x2015;Krin Gabbard, author of <i>Jammin' at the Margins: Jazz and the American Cinema</i><br><br>"David Ake's writing combines the best of modern scholarship with the no-nonsense attitude of a gigging musician. In <i>Jazz Cultures,</i> he seizes upon precisely those issues and historical moments that best reveal how jazz studies might mature into something worthy of the music. A wonderful antidote to the usual cliches of jazz history and a splendid debut."&#x2015;Scott DeVeaux, author of <i>The Birth of Bebop</i><b>David Ake</b> is Professor and Chair of the Department of Musicology at the Frost School of Music, University of Miami.</p><h2>Sterling Test Prep AP Chemistry Practice Questions: High Yield AP Chemistry Questions &amp; Review</h2><p><b>Recommended by teachers.

Setting five novels and more than 50 stories in what he called his "Pennsylvania Protectorate," O'Hara recorded with great honesty the lives of Gibbsville's inhabitants--from Polish coal miners and Irish Catholic shopkeepers to the Protestant country club set. Editor Bruccoli, who championed O'Hara as one of America's great short writers in his biography The O'Hara Concern ( LJ 9/15/75), has gathered into one volume 55 Gibbsville stories written over a 30-year span. Included are some of O'Hara's most famous tales, including "The Doctor's Son," "Imagine Kissing Pete," and "The Bucket of Blood." Since many of these stories are drawn from previous collections, libraries already owning such anthologies as The Collected Stories of John O'Hara ( LJ 4/15/85) might want to consider this an optional purchase.

When I started <i>Conde Nast Traveler</i> in 1986, the ambition was to bring truth to travel, contraband in those days of souped-up public relations and freebies, but relieve the rawness of our independent criticism with the literary graces of such as Robert Hughes, Pico Iyer, Christopher Buckley, Edmund White, Simon Winchester. Well, Henry James made the felicitous combination of honesty and literature before I was born, and this little book is a joy I wish I'd read before. It's small enough to slip into a side pocket. Travel with Henry James. You will never be bored!"<br><b>&#x2013;Harold Evans, <i>Conde Nast Traveler</i></b><br><br>"This is a fascinating collection of reports from travels in England, Europe and the United States, as the young Henry James finds his voice. In this pages he discovers the tone which will become his hallmark as a writer of fiction, a tone which is both precise and leisurely, filled with shapely sentences, and also witty and sharp and perceptive"<br><b>&#x2013;Colm Toibin</b><br><br>"No writer in history was a better describer than James, and nobody could get more mileage from a word like 'physiognomically.' These essays, full of the sweet enthusiasm of the great man's youth, offer vista after vista and delight after delight."<br><b>&#x2013;Ian Frazier</b><br><br></p><h2>Seaworthy Offshore Sailboat: A Guide to Essential Features, Handling, and Gear</h2><p>&#34;An invaluable resource.

Focusing on the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but with an eye toward antiquity and the present, Caroline Walker Bynum explores the themes of metamorphosis and hybridity in genres ranging from poetry, folktales, and miracle collections to scholastic theology, devotional treatises, and works of natural philosophy. She argues that the obsession with boundary-crossing and otherness was an effort to delineate nature's regularities and to establish a strong sense of personal identity, extending even beyond the grave. She examines historical figures such as Marie de France, Gerald of Wales, Bernard Clairvaux, Thomas Aquinas, and Dante, as well as modern fabulists such as Angela Carter, as examples of solutions to the perennial question of how the individual can both change and remain constant. Addressing the fundamental question for historians&#x2015;that of change&#x2015;Bynum also explores the nature of history writing itself.</p></p><p>Caroline Walker Bynum is Professor of Medieval European History, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, and University Professor Emerita at Columbia University. She is the author of<i> Fragmentation and Redemption: Essays on Gender and the Human Body in Medieval Religion</i> and <i>Metamorphosis and Identity</i>, both published by Zone Books.<p>Bynum is asking that even while we deploy all the tricks and tools of modern historical analysis, we take seriously the obligation to marvel at the complexity, at the otherness, of the medieval world, a world that we will never perfectly understand and yet that seems to point to something worth understanding.</p>&#x2015;<b>Patrick J. Geary</b>, The New Republic<br><br><p>Over the past 30 years, Bynum has published an initially contentious series of books that have illuminated many aspects of the oddness of the medieval world... This time she focuses on Christians' intense devotion to objects that they believed both signaled and embodied God's essence and glory.</p>&#x2015;<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i></p><h2>The Process of Parenting</h2><p><i>The Process of Parenting</i> describes the many ways parents and caregivers can translate their love for children into effective parenting behavior. The book has strong emphasis on the development process in terms of children&#x2019;s and parents&#x2019; growth as complex individuals, and in the changing nature of their relationships over time. Because parents and children are distinct individuals, the book includes a problem-solving approach that can help parents arrive at solutions that fit them, their children, and their life circumstances. The ninth edition includes new first person narrative boxes and more emphasis on social context, new evidence-based parenting programs, and international parenting.</p><p>Jane Brooks earned her doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley.

Through his narrator's consciousness, Proust offers readers a comprehensive portrait of the high society of Paris from the 1870s through the First World War.<br><i>Swann's Way</i> begins with the narrator's reminiscences of early childhood &#x2014; including, famously, his evocative memory of eating a pastry called a madeleine &#x2014; and his fascination with what seemed the separate worlds of his family's various neighbors and acquaintances. He then turns his focus to the wealthy connoisseur Charles Swann and his obsessive relationship with the vulgar but radiant courtesan Odette, chronicling in detail the milieu in which it is enacted and its unfortunate effects on him.<br><i>Du c�t� de chez Swann</i> first appeared in 1913. It is a bitingly satiric, often comic evocation of French society that addresses a range of philosophical questions about perception, memory, desire, art, family, and politics. On its own or as part of a larger work, it is a rich search for a reality that transcends the passage of time. </p><p><i></i><i></i></p></p><p></p><h2>How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation</h2><p><p><em>How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation</em> discusses male sexual response and the cause of its disorders, and provides advice on leading a more normal sex life. </p> <p>Based on the same therapeutic methods that have proven clinically effective for 90% of men suffering from premature ejaculation (PE), this straightforward volume describes a rapid, practical self-help program that can be used by single men or couples in the privacy of their home. Dr Kaplan first explains the nature of PE and its causes and then describes her effective treatment techniques. She also discusses the errors and resistances that can arise and provides suggestions on how to overcome them.</p></p><p>Kaplan, author of The New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions (Brunner/Mazel, 1974) and director of the Human Sexuality Program at New York Hospital, emphasizes sensory awareness and partner cooperation in this straightforward self-help guide. The step-by-step, progressive sexual exercises (supplemented by a few superfluous drawings) occupy a mere 18 pages of the text; the bulk of the work details how the reader might serve as his own therapist, recognizing problems when the method seems ineffectual due to "errors and resistances." In simple language, Kaplan guides the reader, emphasizing the high degree of self-cure success with this problem. The only work available that deals exclusively with premature ejaculation, it should prove a useful addition to self-help collections.<br><i>- Robert Aken, Univ. of Kentucky Libs., Lexington</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.<p>'Still considered the definitive guide to conquering PE.' - Men's Health,&nbsp;December 2005</p></p><h2>Eight Men: Short Stories</h2><p><p>Here, in these powerful stories, Richard Wright takes readers into this landscape once again. </p><p>Each of the eight stories in <em>Eight Men</em> focuses on a black man at violent odds with a white world, reflecting Wright's views about racism in our society and his fascination with what he called "the struggle of the individual in America."

Anyhow, his mother was putting supper on the table. Them niggers can't understan nothing. One of these days he was going to get a gun and practice shooting, then they couldn't talk to him as though he were a little boy. He slowed, looking at the ground. Shucks, Ah ain scareda them even ef they are biggern me! Aw, Ah know whut Ahma do. Ahm going by of Joe's sto n git that Sears Roebuck catlog n look at them guns. Mebbe Ma will femme buy one when she Bits mah pay from of man Hawkins. Ahma beg her t gimme some money. Ahm of ernough to hava gun. Ahm seventeen. Almost a man. He strode, feeling his long loose-jointed limbs. Shucks, a man oughta hava little gun aftah he done worked hard all day.</p><p>He came in sight of Joe's store. A yellow lantern glowed on the front porch. He mounted steps and went through the screen door, hearing it bang behind him. There was a strong smell of coal oil and mackerel fish. He felt very confident until he saw fat Joe walk in through the rear door, then his courage began to ooze.</p><p>"Howdy, Dave! Whutcha want?"</p><p>"How yuh, Mistah Joe? Aw, Ah don wanna buy nothing. Ah jus wanted t see ef yuhd lemme look at tha catlog erwhile."</p><p>"Sure! You wanna see it here?"</p><p>"Nawsuh. Ah wans t take it home wid me.

Then he looked up shyly.</p><p>"Ah'll tell yuh, Mistah Joe, ef yuh promise yuh won't tell."</p><p>"I promise."</p><p>"Waal, Ahma buy a gun:"</p><p>"A gun? Whut you want with a gun?"</p><p>"Ah wanna keep it."</p><p>"You ain't nothing but a boy. You don't need a gun."</p><p>"Aw, femme have the catlog, Mistah Joe. Ah'll bring it back."</p><p>Joe walked through the rear door. Dave was elated. He looked around at barrels of sugar and flour. He heard Joe coming back. He craned his neck to see if he were bringing the book. Yeah, he's got it. Gawddog, he's got it!</p><p>"Here, but be sure you bring it back. It's the only one I got.</p><p>"Sho, Mistah Joe:"</p><p>"Say, if you wanna buy a gun, why don't you buy one from me?

Ahma git some money from Ma n buy me a gun! Only two dollahs! He tucked the thick catalogue under his arm and hurried.</p><p>"Where yuh been, boy?" His mother held a steaming dish of black-eyed peas.</p><p>"Aw, Ma, Ah jus stopped down the road t talk wid theboys. "</p><p>"Yuh know bettah t keep suppah waitin."</p><p>He sat down, resting the catalogue on the edge of the table.</p><p>"Yuh git up from there and git to the well n wash yosef! Ah ain feedin no hogs in mah house!"</p><p>She grabbed his shoulder and pushed him. He stumbled out of the room, then came back to get the catalogue.</p><p>"Whut this?"</p><p>"Aw, Ma, it's jusa catlog."</p><p>"Who yuh git it from?"</p><p>"From Joe, down at the sto."</p><p>"Waal, thas good.

Yuh crazy?"</p><p>"But Ma, please. It ain mine! It's Joe's! He tol me t bring it back t im termorrow."</p><p>She gave up the book. He stumbled down the back steps, hugging the thick book under his arm. When he had splashed water on his face and hands, he groped back to the kitchen and fumbled in a corner for the towel. He bumped into a chair; it clattered to the floor. The catalogue sprawled at his feet. When he had dried his eyes he snatched up the book and held it again under his arm. His mother stood watching him.</p><p>"Now, ef yuh gonna act a fool over that of book, Ah'll take it n burn it up."</p><p>"Naw, Ma, please:"</p><p>"Waal, set down n be still!"</p><p>He sat down and drew the oil lamp close. He thumbed page after page, unaware of the food his mother set on the table. His father came in. Then his small brother.</p><p>"Whutcha got there, Dave?" his father asked.</p><p>"Jusa catlog," he answered, not looking up.</p><p>"Yeah, here they is!" His eyes glowed at blue-and-black revolvers. He glanced up, feeling sudden guilt. His father was watching him. He eased the book under the table and rested it on his knees. After the blessing was asked, he ate. He scooped up peas and swallowed fat meat without chewing. Buttermilk helped to wash it down. He did not want to mention money before his father. He would do much better by cornering his mother when she was alone. He looked at his father uneasily out of the edge of his eye.</p></p><h2>The CRC&#39;s Guide to Coordinating Clinical Research</h2><p><i>The CRC's Guide to Coordinating Clinical Research</i> is a comprehensive training resource for investigative site staff.

Soon after leaving Tahiti, Master&#x2019;s Mate Fletcher Christian led a successful revolt, setting Bligh and eighteen of his men adrift. In his journal, fellow mutineer James Morrison recounts the <i>Bounty&#x2019;s</i> voyage from his perspective as the boatswain&#x2019;s mate, placing considerable blame for the mutiny on Bligh&#x2019;s irascible personality and style of command. This event, however, simply introduces Morrison&#x2019;s remarkable journey through the South Seas.A born storyteller, Morrison presents compelling tales after the <i>Bounty</i> mutiny, beginning with ringleader Fletcher Christian&#x2019;s two bloody, ill-fated attempts to establish a refuge on the island of Tubuai. Morrison then recounts his eighteen month sojourn on Tahiti, where he constructed a seaworthy schooner and closely observed every aspect of the island and its way of life. He also includes the subsequent arrival of H.M.S. <i>Pandora</i>, which was charged with bringing the mutineers back to England for trial, and his imprisonment in the horrific &#x201c;Pandora&#x2019;s Box.&#x201d; Morrison once again faces peril when the <i>Pandora</i> sinks on Australia&#x2019;s Great Barrier Reef, where thirty-one of the crew and four prisoners perished.Although Morrison did not actively participate in the <i>Bounty</i> insurrection, he had remained with Fletcher Christian&#x2019;s party, which was enough evidence for condemnation once back in England. While imprisoned, Morrison began composing his journal. He was released&#x2015;King George III granted a pardon&#x2015;and soon after wrote the second half of the journal, which he filled with detailed descriptions of Tahitian life, culture, and natural history. Morrison&#x2019;s journal is an invaluable resource for naval historians and an enthralling tale for the general reader.</p><p>Donald A.

Rory Muir looks beyond the purely military aspects of the struggle to show how the entire British nation played a part in the victory. His book provides a total assessment of how politicians, the press, the crown, civilians, soldiers and commanders together defeated France.<br>Beginning in 1807 when all of continental Europe was under Napoleon's control, the author traces the course of the war throughout the Spanish uprising of 1808, the campaigns of the Duke of Wellington and Sir John Moore in Portugal and Spain, and the crossing of the Pyrenees by the British army, to the invasion of southern France and the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. Muir sets Britain's military operations on the Iberian Peninsula within the context of the wider European conflict, and examines how diplomatic, financial, military and political considerations combined to shape policies and priorities. Just as political factors influenced strategic military decisions, Muir contends, fluctuations of the war affected British political decisions.<br>The book is based on a comprehensive investigation of primary and secondary sources, and on a thorough examination of the vast archives left by the Duke of Wellington. Muir offers vivid new insights into the personalities of Canning, Castlereagh, Perceval, Lord Wellesley, Wellington and the Prince Regent, along with fresh information on the financial background of Britain's campaigns. This vigorous narrative account will appeal to general readers and military enthusiasts, as well as to students of early nineteenth-century British politics and military history.</p><p>Muir is a visiting research fellow at the University of Adelaide</p><h2>Classics Reimagined, The Time Machine</h2><p><b>Retold with stunning modern illustration by the studio team Ale&nbsp;+&nbsp;Ale,&nbsp;<i>The Time Machine</i> is a masterpiece of invention and storytelling from the father of science fiction, H.

One of the nation's leading historians of the Cold War period, she is the author of <i>Many Are the Crimes.</i>The contributors to this collection are after big game: the American sense of triumphalism that followed the end of Soviet communism. Coming from the political left, they attack the claims of those who believe America's military might, market economy and its values explain and justify its pre-eminence. They succeed in rendering more complex the origins and costs of U.S. dominance in the world. Two of the most successful essays, by Leo Ribuffo and Bruce Cumings, take on the intellectual difficulties with the right's historical explanations for the collapse of Soviet communism. Two other sparkling essays, by Jessica Wang and Chalmers Johnson, respectively, clarify how cooperative internationalism has long been a powerful theme of American foreign relations and how the Cold War has never ended in East Asia and Latin America. Yet too many of the authors have yielded to ideological temptations, which distort understanding of the past. Carolyn Eisenberg, for instance, argues that the U.S. caused Germany's division and the Berlin crisis in the late 1940s. Her case is plausible as a prosecutor's brief but inadequate as history, which requires acknowledgment of other positions and what strengths they may possess. Yet despite imbalance, this collection performs a valuable service. No one interested in the origins, costs and benefits of American hegemony can overlook it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The history of Ireland has long been a topic at the forefront of debate and one that continues to raise emotions and be the cause of much dispute. It is astonishing that such a small area of land has had one of the most controversial yet fascinating histories of any country in the world. Interest in Irish culture, politics, and society, both ancient and modern, never seems to falter, not only in scholarly circles but also among the general public. With over 1,800 entries, the Companion, now in its second edition, continues to offer a comprehensive and authoritative guide to all aspects of the Irish past from earliest times to the present day. There is coverage not only of leading political figures, organizations, and events but also of subjects such as dress, music, sport, and diet. Traditional topics such as the rebellion of 1798 and the Irish Civil War sit alongside entries on newly developing areas such as women&#39;s history and popular culture. The editor, Sean Connolly, with the help of the existing 87 contributors and a small number of new contributors, has updated and revised the text to take into account recent research and events. The coverage has been expanded to offer a fuller treatment of prehistoric and early historic Ireland and more comprehensive information on literary history. There are also new entries on individuals who have died since the first edition was published. In addition the sections dealing with politics in the Irish Republic and in Northern Ireland have been rewritten to take full account of developments up to the end of the 20th century. New / rewritten entries include: Visual Arts (art schools, ceramics, furniture, history painting, painting, sculpture) Politics / Religion (Brendan Corish, James Dillon, Sean MacDermott, Alfred O&#39;Rahilly, peace process, Progressive Democrats, Michael Tierney, Workers&#39; Party) Literature (Dun Emer Press, Lady Augusta Gregory, James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Jane (&#39;Speranza&#39;) Wilde) Prehistoric and Early Ireland (Bronze Age Ireland, Celtic Ireland, crannog, La Tene in Ireland, Mesolithic Ireland, Neolithic Ireland, rath) Medieval Ireland (fuidir, MacCarthy, O&#39;Brien, O&#39;Donnell, senchleithe, sept) Other (agriculture, Devon Commission, John Henry Newman, Ulster Scots) In addition to A-Z entries the Companion includes a section of maps showing the shape of modern Ireland, post-reformation ecclesiastical divisions in Ireland, political divisions circa 800, Ireland circa 1350, Ireland in the late 15th century, and the pattern of transport and communications in Ireland. There is also a subject index, which groups headwords into thematic batches to provide an alternative way to access the entries. This second edition of the Companion, continuing on from the original, will be valuable to different people for different uses. It will be of particular use to students as a work of general reference and to the general public with an interest in the history and culture of Ireland. But it should also have appeal to academics, both for the longer analytical entries and as a source of reference for topics outside of their immediate area of expertise.</p><p>&#34;Review from previous edition a compilation which, without sacrificing scholarship, triumphantly lays before the reader so much that is both useful and new...this is a companion to be cherished&#34;--Toby Barnard, TLS &#34;will provide an essential reference work for all journalists, historians, diplomats and indeed anyone who wishes to find out quickly the who, the when, and the what in Irish history&#34;--Thomas Bartlett, Irish Times &#34;judicious and authoritative...invaluable to academics and taxi drivers alike&#34;--Roy Foster, The Times &#34;fine book of reference&#34;--Edward Pearce, History Today &#34;Review from previous edition a compilation which, without sacrificing scholarship, triumphantly lays before the reader so much that is both useful and new...this is a companion to be cherished&#34;--Toby Barnard, TLS &#34;will provide an essential reference work for all journalists, historians, diplomats and indeed anyone who wishes to find out quickly the who, the when, and the what in Irish history&#34;--Thomas Bartlett, Irish Times &#34;judicious and authoritative...invaluable to academics and taxi drivers alike&#34;--Roy Foster, The Times &#34;fine book of reference&#34;--Edward Pearce, History Today &#34;Review from previous edition a compilation which, without sacrificing scholarship, triumphantly lays before the reader so much that is both useful and new...this is a companion to be cherished&#34;--Toby Barnard, TLS &#34;will provide an essential reference work for all journalists, historians, diplomats and indeed anyone who wishes to find out quickly the who, the when, and the what in Irish history&#34;--Thomas Bartlett, Irish Times &#34;judicious and authoritative...invaluable to academics and taxi drivers alike&#34;--Roy Foster, The Times &#34;fine book of reference&#34;--Edward Pearce, History Today &#34;Review from previous edition a compilation which, without sacrificing scholarship, triumphantly lays before the reader so much that is both useful and new...this is a companion to be cherished&#34;--Toby Barnard, TLS &#34;will provide an essential reference work for all journalists, historians, diplomats and indeed anyone who wishes to find out quickly the who, the when, and the what in Irish history&#34;--Thomas Bartlett, Irish Times &#34;judicious and authoritative...invaluable to academics and taxi drivers alike&#34;--Roy Foster, The Times &#34;fine book of reference&#34;--Edward Pearce, History TodayAffordable paperback of the latest edition of the definitive reference work on all aspects of the Irish past</p><h2>The Literary West: An Anthology of Western American Literature</h2><p>This anthology, gathered and introduced by distinguished western scholar Thomas J. Lyon, offers the panoramic literary range of the American West, from the romance of the mythic Wild West to the present-day creative explosion of the real, diverse West.<br> The real West has been written about since first contact in the sixteenth century, in the diaries of explorers ranging from Franciscan missionary Pedro Font to Lewis and Clark. A Native American tradition of cultural expression preceded European settlers by thousands of years, and today a contemporary Native renaissance in fiction includes writers N. Scott Momaday and Linda Hogan. The naturalist John Muir stands at the beginning of a lineage of western nature writers, and successors including Mary Austin, Edward Abbey, and Rick Bass have raised ecological awareness of the West.<br> Over the past century, there has also been a tremendous drive in western fiction to cut through the mythology spread by the "dime novels" that gained popularity in the 1860s; Owen Wister's <em>The Virginian</em> and Zane Grey's <em>Riders of the Purple Sage</em> presented a simplified and heroic West that would hold sway in the public imagination until serious novelists like Willa Cather, John Steinbeck, and Wallace Stegner established a shadow country to the mythic frontier. Today, works coming from ethnic minority writers including Amy Tan, Denise Chavez, and Rudolph Anaya have helped bring the real, diverse West to light. This authoritative and adventuresome collection shows why the West has occupied such a prominent place in the national consciousness, and reveals that western writers may currently be mapping out a significant development in American thought.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas J. Lyon</strong> is Professor <em>Emeritus</em> of English at Utah State University and former President of the Western Literature Association.<br>"Distinguished western scholar Thomas J.

In this book, Carl Smith explores the imaginative dimensions of these events as he traces the evolution of beliefs that increasingly linked city, disorder, and social reality in the minds of Americans. Studying a remarkable range of writings and illustrations, as well as protests, public gatherings, trials, hearings, and urban reform and construction efforts, Smith argues that these three events&#x2014;and the public awareness of the them&#x2014;not only informed one another, but collectively shaped how Americans saw, and continue to see, the city.</p><p><b>Carl Smith</b> is the Franklyn Bliss Snyder Professor of English and American Studies and professor of history at Northwestern University.

In this still timely classic, James examines the range of religious phenomena: conversion, repentance, mysticism, saintliness, the hopes of reward and the fears of punishment.</p><p><i>"I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><h2>Indivisible (Native Agents)</h2><p><p><b>This odd, transcendent and triumphant novel completes Howe's series of quasi-autobiographical, radically philosophical fictions begun in 1972.</b></p><p>This odd, transcendent and triumphant novel published in 2000 completes a quasi-autobiographical, radically philosophical series of fictions Howe began with First Marriage, published in 1972. Like Howe, Henny's life spans the tempestuous multi-racial world of hipsters and activists in working-class Boston during the 60s and its subsequent fall-out. On the verge of religious conversion, Henny, the book's narrator, locks her husband McCool in a closet so that she might talk better to God. Then she proceeds to make peace with the dead by telling their stories. Lewis, Henny's true love, is a wheelchair-bound black activist and political journalist whose working-class mother is jailed when the group's cache of explosives is found in her home. Then there's their wealthy friend Libby, who crosses the globe in search of enlightenment and spiritual peace. Guiding these characters on their journey are figures as divergent as Nietzsche and Bambi, Marx and St. John of the Cross. As Christopher Martin writes in Rain Taxi, Henny's function as a narrator is to hoist the entire structure of the novel onto her brittle, uneven shoulders and deliver all the embarrassing facts directly to us, her reader/God&#x2015;only then do we realize the full breadth and beauty of the narrative Howe has surreptitiously constructed all along.</p></p><p>Fanny Howe is the author of several works of fiction (most recently, <i>Economics</i> from Flood Editions) and collections of poems, including <i>One Crossed Out</i> and <i>Gone</i>. She is the winner of the 2000 Lenore Marshall Award for her Selected Poems. Her first collection of essays, <i>The Wedding Dress</i>, was published by UC Press in the Fall of 2003. She lives in Massachusetts but remains Professor Emeritus at UCSD in the Department of Literature.Experimental poet and novelist Howe tells the story of modern-day martyr Henny, a filmmaker living in a working-class Boston neighborhood and married to McCool, an alcoholic musician whose jealousy and depression lead to tragedy. The couple have never had children of their own; instead, Henny raises a band of foster children and opens her dilapidated home to transients for extra money. But the most significant connections in her life are those she forges with her friends. Libby, whom she has known since childhood, when her mother was Libby's family's maid, is a wealthy but troubled "free spirit" who is strangely loyal to Henny, even as she betrays her by sleeping with McCool (albeit with permission). Lewis, Henny's first love, is a wheelchair-bound black activist and writer. Henny turns to mysticism and philosophy to attempt to make sense of her life--Buddhism, Marxism and Catholicism are just a few of her guiding forces; figures as divergent as Nietzsche and Bambi also serve as touchstones. On a practical level, the novel is sometimes confusing: Henny, though rooted in Boston, bounces among locales without much explanation, and time is anything but linear. Issues of race, class, sex and religion are seized upon and abandoned, and a few peripheral characters are never sufficiently fleshed out. Somehow, though, as viewed through Henny's eyes and embodied in her elliptical, dreamlike films, the strange logic of the novel hangs together "like finding meteor pebbles in the sole of your sneaker." (Jan.)Forecasts: Fans of Howe's poetry should enjoy this one, as should readers who relish the work of such avant-garde gender-benders as Anne Carson. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Native Peoples of the Olympic Peninsula: Who We Are</h2><p><p>The nine Native tribes of Washington State&#x2019;s Olympic Peninsula&#x2014;the Hoh, Skokomish, Squaxin Island, Lower Elwha Klallam, Jamestown S&#x2019;Klallam, Port Gamble S&#x2019;Klallam, Quinault, Quileute, and Makah&#x2014;share complex histories of trade, religion, warfare, and kinship, as well as reverence for the teaching of elders.

From the late 1960s through the 1970s she created a series of unconventional artworks in parallel to a lengthy psychoanalytic therapy, leading her to develop a series of therapeutic propositions grounded in art. Clark has become a major reference for contemporary artists dealing with the limits of conventional forms of art.</p><p><p><strong>Cornelia Butler</strong> is Chief Curator at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Luis Perez-Oramas</strong> is the Estrellita Brodsky Curator of Latin American Art for the Department of Drawings and Prints at The Museum of Modern Art.</p><p><strong>Sergio Bessa</strong> is the director of curatorial and education programs at the Bronx Museum, and a teacher of Museum Education at Columbia University.</p><p><strong>Eleonora Fabiao</strong> is a performer/performance theorist and Associate Professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.</p><p><strong>Briony Fer</strong> is a British art historian, curator and Professor of History of Art at University College London.</p><p><strong>Geaninne Guti�rrez-Guimar�es</strong> has curated for the Museum of Modern Art and the Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery.</p><p><strong>Andre Lepecki</strong> is Associate Professor at the Department of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University.

This retrospective represents the first for the artist in North America, and surveys everything from her efforts in painting and sculpture to her move into Conceptualism. (Howard Halle <i>Time Out New York</i>)<br><br>As Lygia Clark's current MoMA retrospective finally brings her career more fully into view, so, too, arrive overdue scholarship, insights, and revelations about her work. Devotees of the Brazilian artist already know that previous monographs were scant and expansive, and that much of the key criticism about her, as well as her own prose, hadn't been translated from Portuguese. Offering a strong corrective, this catalogue strives to be definitive, with essays by ten authors alongside nearly three hundred spaciously arranged images of Clark's boundary-breaking art. (Lauren O'Neill-Butler <i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>...a big, openhearted retrospective of the great Brazilian artist who made the arduous look effortless. (<i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>Now regarded as one of the postwar era's most important artists, Lygia Clark produced a generative body of abstract painting in the 1950s, reinvented sculpture with her participatory objects of the '60s, and later devised an altogether unique mode of ritualistic, collective quasi therapy. (Daniel Quiles <i>Artforum</i>)</p><h2>The Undeserving Rich: American Beliefs about Inequality, Opportunity, and Redistribution</h2><p>It is widely assumed that Americans care little about income inequality, believe opportunities abound, admire the rich, and dislike redistributive policies. Leslie McCall contends that such assumptions are based on both incomplete survey data and economic conditions of the past and not present. In fact, Americans have desired less inequality for decades, and McCall&#39;s book explains why. Americans become most concerned about inequality in times of inequitable growth, when they view the rich as prospering while opportunities for good jobs, fair pay, and high quality education are restricted for everyone else. As a result, they favor policies to expand opportunity and redistribute earnings in the workplace, reducing inequality in the market rather than redistributing income after the fact with tax and spending policies. This book resolves the paradox of how Americans can express little enthusiasm for welfare state policies and still yearn for a more equitable society and forwards a new model of preferences about income inequality rooted in labor market opportunities rather than welfare state policies.</p><p>Most assume that Americans care little about income inequality, believe opportunities abound, admire the rich, and dislike redistributive policies.

As gunners, radio operators, signalmen, and medics assigned to some six thousand merchant ships, the guardsmen helped get desperately needed supplies to their destinations. Often working under horrendous conditions, they frequently engaged the enemy in the U-boat-infested Atlantic, on the deadly Murmansk Run, and in the Mediterranean Pacific, and Indian oceans. To tell their story Justin Gleichauf spent five years gathering material and interviewing more than one hundred Naval Armed Guard veterans. This dramatic narrative history draws heavily on their interviews, and the veterans&#39; lively accounts are supported by an authoritative analysis of their activities. The result is a complete picture of life aboard an astounding variety of vessels, including the famed liberty ships, and a moving tribute to the wartime service of these so-called stepchildren of the U.S. Navy.</p><p></p><h2>Foucault And Political Reason: Liberalism, Neo-Liberalism And The Rationalities Of Government</h2><p>This work fills a gap in literature by outlining a Foucaultian approach to the study of government and the state.</p><p>These twelve essays provide a critical introduction to Foucault&#39;s work on politics, exploring its relevance to past and current thinking about liberal and neo-liberal forms of government. Moving away from the great texts of liberal political philosophy, this book looks closely at the technical means with which the ideals of liberal political rationalities have been put into practice in such areas as schools, welfare, the insurance industry, and the self-esteem movement in California.Barry is lecturer in sociology at Goldsmiths College, University of London.

In contrast to traditions suggesting that Islam did not take root in Africa, David Robinson depicts the complex struggles of Muslims throughout the continent: in Morocco and the Hausaland region of Nigeria; the &#34;pagan&#34; societies of Ashanti (Ghana) and Buganda (Uganda); and the ostensibly Christian state of Ethiopia. &#34;Further reading&#34; sections suggest how undergraduate readers can pursue research, and illustrations and maps supplement the text.</p><p>David Robinson and Mary Ann DiSpirito have carefully selected over 200 images, most of which are previously unpublished, that illustrate the many changes that Burlington has endured since the 1860s. Included in Burlington Volume II are images of the city that date prior to the 1860s, when our ancestors depended on sketches and engravings to preserve memories. DiSpirito is the author of several short stories and numerous magazine articles in regional and national publications, while Robinson has <br>written several books and many magazine articles. The combination of fascinating images and informative captions will make Burlington Volume II a treasured addition to the personal libraries of residents and visitors for years to come.&#34;Undoubtedly, the importance of this publication goes beyond its uniqueness as the first undergraduate textbook to cover the historical spread and appropriation of Islam in Africa in such a comprehensive manner....The greatest strength of Robinson&#39;s case studies lies in the questions they raise, questions that are still acutely relevant to Muslim communities today and are at the center of global debates about Islam, both inside and outside Muslim communities.&#34;-Rahma Bavelaar, IslamOnline.net</p><h2>Advanced Environmental Exercise Physiology (Advanced Exercise Physiology)</h2><p><p>Students entering advanced study of environmental physiology may have little experience in researching environmental physiology or may not realize the depth and breadth of the field. <i>Advanced Environmental Exercise Physiology </i>offers the first complete look at the scope and major ideas of environmental exercise physiology.

The first two books have not survived&#x2014;our narrative begins with events in 333 BCE&#x2014;and there is material missing from books V, VI, and X. One of his main sources is Cleitarchus who, about 300 BCE, had made Alexander's career a matter of marvellous adventure.</p><p>Curtius is not a critical historian; and in his desire to entertain and to stress the personality of Alexander, he elaborates effective scenes, omits much that is important for history, and does not worry about chronology. But he does not invent things, except speeches and letters inserted into the narrative by traditional habit. 'I copy more than I believe', he says. Three features of his story are narrative of exciting experiences, development of a hero's character, and a disposition to moralise. His history is one of the five extant works on which we rely for the career of Alexander the Great.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Quintus Curtius is in two volumes.</p></p><p><p>John Carew Rolfe (1859&#x2013;1943) taught at Cornell, Harvard, and the Universities of Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p></p><h2>Global Warming For Dummies</h2><p><b>Get positive suggestions for practical solutions to this heated issue.</b> <p>Hotly debated in the political arena and splashed across the media almost 24/7, global warming has become the topic of the moment.

From ancient Greek theatre up to the most recent plays, playwrights have found, in tragic drama, a means to seek explanation for disaster. But tragedy is also a word we continually encounter in the media, to denote an event which is simply devastating in its emotional power. This introduction explores the relationship between tragic experience and tragic representation. After giving an overview of the tragic theatre canon - including chapters on the Greeks, Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekhov, post-colonial drama, and Beckett - it also looks at the contribution which philosophers have brought to this subject, before ranging across other art-forms and areas of debate. The book is unique in its chronological range, and brings a wide spectrum of examples, from both literature and life, into the discussion of this emotional and frequently controversial subject.</p><p>This introduction offers an overview of tragic drama from the ancient Greeks, through Shakespeare, Racine and Ibsen, and to the present day. It explores the definition of &#39;tragedy&#39;, as it has been discussed by philosophers, and includes chapters on the Greeks, Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekhov, post-colonial drama, and Beckett.Jennifer Wallace is Fellow, lecturer and Director of Studies in English at Peterhouse, University of Cambridge.</p><h2>Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism (Oxford Paperbacks)</h2><p>From Bishop Wilberforce in the 1860s to the advocates of "creation science" today, defenders of traditional mores have condemned Darwin's theory of evolution as a threat to society's values. Darwin's defenders, like Stephen Jay Gould, have usually replied that there is no conflict between science and religion--that values and biological facts occupy separate realms. But as James Rachels points out in this thought-provoking study, Darwin himself would disagree with Gould. Darwin, who had once planned on being a clergyman, was convinced that natural selection overthrew our age-old religious beliefs.<br> <em>Created from Animals</em> offers a provocative look at how Darwinian evolution undermines many tenets of traditional philosophy and religion. James Rachels begins by examining Darwin's own life and work, presenting an astonishingly vivid and compressed biography. We see Darwin's studies of the psychological links in evolution (such as emotions in dogs, and the "mental powers" of worms), and how he addressed the moral implications of his work, especially in his concern for the welfare of animals. Rachels goes on to present a lively and accessible survey of the controversies that followed in Darwin's wake, ranging from Herbert Spencer's Social Darwinism to Edward O. Wilson's sociobiology, and discusses how the work of such influential intellects as Descartes, Hume, Kant, T.H. Huxley, Henri Bergson, B.F. Skinner, and Stephen Jay Gould has contributed to--or been overthrown by--evolutionary science.<br> Western philosophy and religion, Rachels argues, have been shaken by the implications of Darwin's work, most notably the controversial idea that humans are simply a more complex kind of animal. Rachels assesses a number of studies that suggest how closely humans are linked to other primates in behavior, and then goes on to show how this idea undercuts the work of many prominent philosophers. Kant's famous argument that suicide reduces one to the level of an animal, for instance, is meaningless if humans are, in fact, animals. Indeed, humanity's membership in the animal kingdom calls into question the classic notions of human dignity and the sacredness of human life. What we need now, Rachels contends, is a philosophy that does not discriminate between different species, one that addresses each being on an individual basis.<br> With this sweeping survey of the arguments, the philosophers, and the deep implications surrounding Darwinism, Rachels lays the foundations for a new view of morality. Vibrantly written and provocatively argued, <em>Created from Animals</em> offers a new perspective on issues ranging from suicide to euthanasia to animal rights.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>James Rachels</strong> is University Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Through his eyes we see all the realities of war; under fire, on patrol, waiting in the trenches, at home on leave, and in hospitals and dressing stations.

Its overarching goal is to provide readers with the knowledge necessary to make proper interpretations and select appropriate techniques for analyzing multivariate data. <b></b> Chapter topics include aspects of multivariate analysis, matrix algebra and random vectors, sample geometry and random sampling, the multivariate normal distribution, inferences about a mean vector, comparisons of several multivariate means, multivariate linear regression models, principal components, factor analysis and inference for structured covariance matrices, canonical correlation analysis, and discrimination and classification. <b></b> For experimental scientists in a variety of disciplines. </p></p><p>A classic applied approach to multivariate analysis for those involved in the social, biological, and physical sciences.<p><b>INTENDED AUDIENCE</b></p> <p> This book originally grew out of our lecture notes for an "Applied Multivariate Analysis" course offered jointly by the Statistics Department and the School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. <i>Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis,</i> Fifth Edition, is concerned with statistical methods for describing and analyzing multivariate data. Data analysis, while interesting with one variable, becomes truly fascinating and challenging when several variables are involved. Researchers in the biological, physical, and social sciences frequently collect measurements on several variables. Modern computer packages readily provide the numerical results to rather complex statistical analyses. We have "tried to provide readers with the supporting knowledge necessary for making proper interpretations, selecting appropriate techniques, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses. We hope our discussions will meet the needs of experimental scientists, in a wide variety of subject matter areas, as a readable introduction to the statistical analysis of multivariate observations. </p> <p><b>LEVEL</b></p> <p> Our aim is to present the concepts and methods of multivariate analysis at a level that is readily understandable by readers who have taken two or more statistics courses. We emphasize the applications of multivariate methods and, consequently, have attempted to make the mathematics as palatable as possible. We avoid the use of calculus. On the other hand, the concepts of a matrix and of matrix manipulations are important. We do not assume the reader is familiar with matrix algebra. Rather, we introduce matrices as they appear naturally in our discussions, and we then show how they simplify the presentation of multivariate models and techniques. </p> <p> The introductory account of matrix algebra, in Chapter 2, highlights the more important matrix algebra results as they apply to multivariate analysis. The Chapter 2 supplement provides a summary of matrix algebra results for those with little or no previous exposure to the subject. This supplementary material helps make the book self-contained and is used to complete proofs. The proofs may be ignored on the first reading. In this way we hope to make the book accessible to a wide audience. </p> <p> In our attempt to make the study of multivariate analysis appealing to a large audience of both practitioners and theoreticians, we have had to sacrifice a consistency of level. Some sections are harder than others. In particular, we have summarized a voluminous amount of material on regression in Chapter 7. The resulting presentation is rather succinct and difficult the first time through. We hope instructors will be able to compensate for the unevenness in level by judiciously choosing those sections, and subsections, appropriate for their students and by toning them down if necessary. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION AND APPROACH</b></p> <p> The methodological "tools" of multivariate analysis are contained in Chapters 5 through 12. These chapters represent the heart of the book, but they cannot be assimilated without much of the material in the introductory Chapters 1 through 4. Even those readers with a good knowledge of matrix algebra or those willing to accept the mathematical results on faith should, at the very least, peruse Chapter 3, "Sample Geometry," and Chapter 4, "Multivariate Normal Distribution." </p> <p> Our approach in the methodological chapters is to keep the discussion direct and uncluttered. Typically, we start with a formulation of the population models, delineate the corresponding sample results, and liberally illustrate everything with examples. The examples are of two types: those that are simple and whose calculations can be easily done by hand, and those that rely on real-world data and computer software. These will provide an opportunity to (1) duplicate our analyses, (2) carry out the analyses dictated by exercises, or (3) analyze the data using methods other than the ones we have used or suggested. </p> <p> The division of the methodological chapters (5 through 12) into three units allows instructors some flexibility in tailoring a course to their needs. Possible sequences for a one-semester (two quarter) course are indicated schematically. </p> <p> Each instructor will undoubtedly omit certain sections from some chapters to cover a broader collection of topics than is indicated by these two choices. </p> <p> For most students, we would suggest a quick pass through the first four chapters (concentrating primarily on the material in Chapter 1; Sections 2.1, 2.212.3, 2.5, 2.6, and 3.6; and the "assessing normality" material in Chapter 4) followed by a selection of methodological topics. For example, one might discuss the comparison of mean vectors, principal components, factor analysis, discriminant analysis and clustering. The discussions could feature the many "worked out" examples included in these sections of the text. Instructors may rely on diagrams and verbal descriptions to teach the corresponding theoretical developments. If the students have uniformly strong mathematical backgrounds, much of the book can successfully be covered in one term. </p> <p> We have found individual data-analysis projects useful for integrating material from several of the methods chapters. Here, our rather complete treatments of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), regression analysis, factor analysis, canonical correlation, discriminant analysis, and so forth are helpful, even though they may not be specifically covered in lectures. </p> <p><b>CHANGES TO THE FIFTH EDITION</b></p> <p> <b>New material.</b> Users of the previous editions will notice that we have added several exercises and data sets, some new graphics, and have expanded the discussion of the dimensionality of multivariate data, growth curves and classification and regression trees (CART). In addition, the algebraic development of correspondence analysis has been redone and a new section on data mining has been added to Chapter 12. We put the data mining material in Chapter 12 since much of data mining, as it is now applied in business, has a classification and/or grouping objective. As always, we have tried to improve the exposition in several places. </p> <p> <b>Data CD.</b> Recognizing the importance of modern statistical packages in the analysis of multivariate data, we have added numerous real-data sets. The full data sets used in the book are saved as ASCII files on the CD-ROM that is packaged with each copy of the book. This format will allow easy interface with existing statistical software packages and provide more convenient hands-on data analysis opportunities. </p> <p> <b>Instructors Solutions Manual.</b> An <i>Instructors Solutions Manual</i> (ISBN 0-13092555-1) containing complete solutions to most of the exercises in the book is available free upon adoption from Prentice Hall. </p> <p> For information on additional for sale supplements that may be used with the book or additional titles of interest, please visit the Prentice Hall Web site at <b>www.prenhall.com</b>. </p></p><h2>Herodotus: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>Hailed by Cicero as "the father of history," Herodotus was both a critical thinker and a lively storyteller, a traveler who was both tourist and anthropologist. Like Homer, he set out to memorialize great deeds in words, in particular, the wars between Greece and Persia. In his hands, the Greeks' unforeseeable defeat of the Persian kings Darius and Xerxes with their vast hosts made for fascinating storytelling. Influenced by the work of the natural scientists and philosophers of his own and earlier eras, Herodotus also brought his literary talents to bear on a vast, unruly mass of historical information, leaving behind him the longest work that had ever been written in Greek. This Very Short Introduction introduces readers to what little is known of Herodotus's life and discusses all aspects of his work, including his travels; his interest in seeing the world and learning about non-Greek civilizations; the recurring themes of his work; his beliefs in dreams, oracles, and omens; the prominence of women in his work; and his account of the battles of the Persian Wars.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jennifer T.

Its thesis is that among all the complexities within the subject matter and operations of casework there are certain constant elements, forces, and processes which give coherence and unity to its practice. Mrs. Perlman identifies and analyzes these constants and views them within the logical framework of problem-solving. In turn, problem-solving as a casework process is examined in its likeness to normal human problem-solving efforts. The result is an approach to learning and thinking about casework which is at once organized, synthesized, and imaginative. The book's usefulness is enhanced by the author's lucid and pointed style.<br></p><p><b>Helen Harris Perlman</b> is the Samuel Deutsch Distinguished Service Professor, Emeritus, in the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago.

Alexander Bickel begins with Marbury v. Madison, which he says give shaky support to judicial review, and concludes with the school desegregation cases of 1954, which he uses to show the extent and limits of the Court&#x2019;s power. In this way he accomplishes his stated purpose: &#x201c;to have the Supreme Court&#x2019;s exercise of judicial review better understood and supported and more sagaciously used.&#x201d; The book now includes a new foreword by Harry H. Wellington. Alexander Mordecai Bickel (1924-1974) was one of the most influential constitutional commentators of the twentieth century. Bickel&#x2019;s most distinctive contribution to constitutional law was to stress what he called &#x201c;the passive virtues&#x201d; of judicial decision-making &#x2013; the refusal to decide cases on substantive grounds if narrower grounds exist to decide the case. Bickel viewed &#x201c;private ordering&#x201d; and the voluntary working-out of problems as generally preferable to legalistic solutions. In his books Bickel attacked the Warren Court for what he saw as its misuse of history, shoddy reasoning, and sometimes arbitrary results. Bickel thought that the Warren Court&#x2019;s two most important lines of decision, Brown v. Board of Education and Baker v. Carr, did not produce the results the Court had intended. In his book The Least Dangerous Branch, Bickel coined the term counter-majoritarian difficulty to describe his view that judicial review stands in tension with democratic theory. Bickel envisioned the Supreme Court as playing a statesman-like role in national controversies, engaging in dialogue with the other branches of government. Thus he did not see the Court as a purely passive body, but as one which should lead public opinion, albeit carefully.</p><p>This classic book on the role of the Supreme court in our democracy traces the history of the Court, assessing the merits of various decisions along the way. Eminent law professor Alexander Bickel begins with Marbury vs. Madison, which he says gives gives shaky support to judicial review, and concludes with the school desegregation cases of 1954, which he uses to show the extent and limits of the Court&#39;s power. In this way he accomplishes his stated purpose: &#39;to have the Supreme Court&#39;s exercise of judicial review better understood and supported and more sagaciously used.&#39;<p>"Alexander Bickel attempted to resolve the central problem of constitutional law: Our political ethos is majoritarian, but the court, possessing the power to nullify laws democratically enacted, is countermajoritarian. The problem becomes acute when the court imposes principles not to be found in the Constitution. Mr. Bickel justified that role by saying that courts should apply principles drawn from the 'evolving morality of our tradition.' Written gracefully and offering many insights into constitutional doctrines, this book is the most intellectually honest, if unsuccessful, defense of non-originalism of which I am aware."&#x2014;Robert Bork, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><br>Named as "Five Best books on the U.S. Constitution" by Robert Bork in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br></p><h2>Aromatherapy: Soothing Remedies to Restore, Rejuvenate and Heal</h2><p>Science has now confirmed what has been known since the time of the Caesars: essential oils have healing properties for a wide variety of physical and emotional conditions.

For example, politicians who simply look more competent are more likely to win elections. Yet the character judgments we make from faces are as inaccurate as they are irresistible; in most situations, we would guess more accurately if we ignored faces. So why do we put so much stock in these widely shared impressions? What is their purpose if they are completely unreliable? In this book, Alexander Todorov, one of the world's leading researchers on the subject, answers these questions as he tells the story of the modern science of first impressions.</p><p>Drawing on psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, computer science, and other fields, this accessible and richly illustrated book describes cutting-edge research and puts it in the context of the history of efforts to read personality from faces. Todorov describes how we have evolved the ability to read basic social signals and momentary emotional states from faces, using a network of brain regions dedicated to the processing of faces. Yet contrary to the nineteenth-century pseudoscience of physiognomy and even some of today's psychologists, faces don't provide us a map to the personalities of others. Rather, the impressions we draw from faces reveal a map of our own biases and stereotypes.</p><p>A fascinating scientific account of first impressions, <i>Face Value </i>explains why we pay so much attention to faces, why they lead us astray, and what our judgments actually tell us.</p></p><p><p>"Faces are what newborns naturally seek. They are the objects of our love, trust, fear, longing, and memory. They inspire poetry and the visual arts. We rely on faces to reveal mood and character, allowing them to influence hiring decisions, criminal convictions, and elections. In this magisterial work, Todorov takes us on a tour of the face, its role in human affairs, and its power to influence and mislead. You'll always look at faces, but never the same way again."<b>--Eldar Shafir, coauthor of <i>Scarcity: The New Science of Having Less and How It Defines Our Lives</i></b></p><p>"Todorov's work is fun and somewhat shocking on the surface, but the deeper implication--that much of our decision-making and behavior is unconscious and unknown to us--goes well beyond his findings about the biases we bring to evaluating the faces of other people. <i>Face Value</i> shows that as much as we think of ourselves as rational creatures in control of what we do we are just as often influenced by eyebrows and chins. Terrifying and enjoyable."<b>--David Byrne, founder of Talking Heads and author of <i>How Music Works</i></b></p><p>"<i>Face Value</i> is an excellent book, with many surprising insights and many compelling illustrations that offer a complex aesthetic experience."<b>--Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and author of <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i></b></p><p>"From one of the world's great experts on the human face, this is a book that illuminates the eternal belief that the face holds the secrets to a person&#x2019;s character.

A gifted and original thinker, Panikkar here issues an invitation to a world spirituality, a human cosmic trust. Spirituality without responsibility is egoism or cowardice, he asserts. He shows how the intense personal and societal reassessment that comes from a serious encounter with world religious traditions radically challenges modern Western assumptions and illumines complex questions of action and contemplation, immanence and transcendence, pluralism and truth, and religious responsibility for the world.</p><p>Raimon Panikkar is Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><h2>The Winters Tale</h2><p>A lavishly illustrated gift edition follows the romantic Shakespearean tale of jealousy, love, and reconciliation, in an edition that is accompanied by printed endpapers, a three-piece case, and a ribbon marker.</p><p>Like every other play in the Cambridge School Shakespeare series, The Winter&#39;s Tale has been specially prepared to help all students in schools and colleges.

Gershom Scholem stands out among them for the richness and power of his historical imagination. Born in Berlin in 1897, Scholem became a Zionist as a young student in a revolt against his family's bourgeois and assimilated life. He learned Hebrew and studied Kabbalah, the world of mystical teachings that had become marginalized--indeed stigmatized--within the mainstream rationalist Jewish tradition. In 1923, Scholem emigrated to Palestine and eventually joined the faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, publishing groundbreaking studies in the field of Jewish mysticism.</p><br><p> In the 1930s, Scholem's scholarship turned to an obscure kabbalist rabbi of seventeenth-century Turkey, Sabbatai &#x1e62;evi, who aroused a fervent following that spread over the Jewish world after he declared himself to be the Messiah. The movement suffered a severe blow when &#x1e62;evi was forced to convert to Islam, but a clandestine sect survived. A Bollingen Foundation grant enabled Scholem to complete the original Hebrew edition of his biography in 1957. Bollingen also supported R. J. Zwi Werblowsky's masterful English translation. A monumental and revisionary work of Jewish historiography, <i>Sabbatai &#x1e62;evi</i> stands out for its combination of philological and empirical authority and for its passion. It is widely esteemed as one of Scholem's masterworks. The author himself always regarded the Princeton/Bollingen edition as a highlight of his scholarship.</p></p><p>Messianic longing and expectation, always rife throughout Jewish history, have often found expression in movements prompted by messianic pretenders, forerunners, or prophets.Text: English, Hebrew (translation)</p><h2>The Second Oldest Profession: An Informal History of Moonshining in America</h2><p>The Second Oldest Profession: An Informal History of Moonshining in America</p><p></p><h2>Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings From the Federal Writers&#39; Project</h2><p><p><strong>A wonderful discovery of folklore writings-many previously unpublished-by Zora Neale Hurston, author of <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>.</strong></p> When Pamala Bordelon was researching a work on the Florida Federal Writers Project, she discovered writings in the collection that were unmistakably from the hand of Zora Neale Hurston, one of the leading writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Over half of the works included here have not been published or are only available in the Library of America edition of Hurston's works. As Hurston's fans know, all of her novels draw upon her deep interest in folklore, particularly from her home state of Florida. Here we see the roots of that work, from the wonderful folktale of the monstrous alligator living in a local lake to her recording of folk songs to her work on children's games and the black church. There are also fiery and controversial essays on race and the work of black artists. In a biographical essay, Pamala Bordelon, with the help of Hurston's niece, has re-created the years during which Hurston was working for the FWP and living in Eatonville. She has put together the portrait of a serious writer and folklorist who was running tight on money, but big on spirit. This book is an important new addition to Hurston's work.</p><p>The writings of distinguished African-American Harlem Renaissance author, folklorist, playwright and anthropologist Hurston during her tenure (1938-39) in the Florida division of the Federal Writers Project, many of them previously unpublished, are collected here. They are augmented by Bordelon's biographical essay about Hurston's life during the year she participated in the project, and by her analysis and commentary. The FWP, a federally funded relief program that provided impoverished writers with employment, offered Hurston the lowliest position of "relief reporter," a title for which she was clearly overqualified. But Hurston, just three generations away from slavery, was accustomed to discrimination in a South where Jim Crow laws were still staunchly upheld. As a reporter for the FWP she was assigned to write 1500 words per week describing the lore of African-American Floridians, as part of a larger project, which was never realized and which, moreover, deleted most of Hurston's contributions from the manuscript-in-progress. Other work she submitted for the FWP was often ignored or heavily edited; a few pieces were included in an automotive guidebook, Florida. Included here are Hurston's transcriptions of African-American oral history: traditions, habits, folklore, lyrics and dances; as well as photographs of Hurston and associates, and her performance pieces and essays. Her notable observations on race, writing, her hometown and the upward mobility of blacks in her time are now invaluable historical resources. For Hurston fans, especially scholars, this book will offer a fuller picture of the writer's lesser-known literary endeavors. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.paper 0-393-31813-3 New work by Hurston (18891968), the Harlem Renaissance writer and folklorist. (Hurstons first collection of folklore, Mules and Men, is generally considered the first such compilation by an African-American. It was followed by Tell My Horse.) During the Depression, like many writers, Hurston went to work for the Works Progress Administration. As part of the Florida Federal Writers Project, she compiled this collection of folklore, parts of which have never been published before. Bordelon, an independent scholar who recovered the manuscript while researching the FWP, contributes a biographical essay on Hurston that focuses in particular on her years with the FWP. In her proposal, reprinted here, Hurston divides Florida into four areas, with different economic, social, and cultural factors influencing local folklore, including black folk religion. Folklore is the boiled- down juice of human living, she writes. Folklore in Florida is still in the making. Folk tunes, tales, and characters are still emerging from the lush place of primitive imagination before they can be finally drained by formal education and mechanical inversions. This volume represents part of Hurstons effort to capture that critical momoent in the development of black folklore, which included the creation of a new prison folk hero, Daddy Mention. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Contributors explore legal history by examining race, crime and punishment, sex across the color line, and slander. Emerging stars and established scholars such as Peter Wood and Carol Berkin weave together the fascinating story of competing agendas and clashing cultures on the southern frontier. One chapter focuses on a community's resistance to a hermaphrodite, where the town court conducted a series of "examinations" to determine the individual's gender. Other pieces address topics ranging from resistance to sexual exploitation on the part of slave women to spousal murders, from interpreting women's expressions of religious ecstasy to a pastor's sermons about depraved sinners and graphic depictions of carnage, all in the name of "exposing" evil, and from a case of infanticide to the practice of state-mandated castration.<br> Several of the authors pay close attention to the social and personal dynamics of interracial women's networks and relationships across place and time. <em>The Devil's Lane</em> illuminates early forms of sexual oppression, inviting comparative questions about authority and violence, social attitudes and sexual tensions, the impact of slavery as well as the twisted course of race relations among blacks, whites, and Indians. Several scholars look particularly at the Gulf South, myopically neglected in traditional literature, and an outstanding feature of this collection.<br> These eighteen original essays reveal why the intersection of sex and race marks an essential point of departure for understanding southern social relations, and a turning point for the field of colonial history. The rich, varied and distinctive experiences showcased in <em>The Devil's Lane</em> provides an extraordinary opportunity for readers interested in women's history, African American history, southern history, and especially colonial history to explore a wide range of exciting issues.<br></p><p>Focusing on matters of race and sex and the intersection of the two, this collection of nearly 20 essays covers the American South for a period of about 200 years ending in 1808. The focus is scholarly, but the book is accessible to history buffs and general readers alike. (The title comes from a term used to describe land in dispute in the colonial South.) In one essay, &#34;The Facts Speak Loudly Enough,&#34; Peter H. Woods tells the shocking story of the massacre of several dozen blacks in Charleston, South Carolina, on the eve of the American Revolution. Another, Paul Finkelman&#39;s &#34;Crimes of Love, Misdemeanors of Passion: The Regulation of Race and Sex in the Colonial South,&#34; explores the ways in which authorities tried to proscribe miscegenation in Virginia from the 1600s on, and notes one practical reason that there has always been race mixing in America: in the 1630s, the ratio of male immigrants to female in Virginia was 6-1.<br><strong>Catherine Clinton</strong> is the author of several books on southern history, women's history, and Civil War studies including <em>The Plantation Mistress</em>, <em>Half Sisters of History</em>, Tara Revisited, and <em>Divided Houses</em> (OUP 1992). <strong>Michele Gillespie</strong> is Associate Professor of American history at Agnes Scott College in Atlanta.

He lives in Cape May, New Jersey.The standard field guides tend to assume that the observer will be close enough to the bird to pick out details of color and patterns for identification. Hawks, falcons, and their kin, however, are often seen in flight at distances far too great for color and pattern to be apparent: can they still be accurately identified? Yes, say the authors of this guide to the 23 most abundant and widespread raptors of the United States and Canada, who then show how with text and pictures. Serious birders can, and will want to, learn these techniques, so the book will be a worthwhile addition to all popular ornithology collections. (Photos not seen).

Yet suburban voices remain largely unheard in sociological and cultural studies of these same communities. In <i>Suburban Landscapes: Culture and Politics in a New York Metropolitan Community</i>, Paul Mattingly provides a new model for understanding suburban development through his narrative history of Leonia, New Jersey, an early commuter suburb of New York City.</p><p>Although Leonia is a relatively small suburb, a study of this kind has national significance because most of America's suburbs began as rural communities, with histories that predated the arrival of commuters and real estate developers. Examining the dynamics of community cultural formation, Mattingly contests the prevailing urban and suburban dichotomy. In doing so, he offers a respite from journalistic cliches and scholarly bias about the American suburb, providing instead an insightful, nuanced look at the integrative history of a region.</p><p>Mattingly examines Leonia's politics and culture through three eras of growth and change (1859-94, 1894-1920, and 1920-60). A major part of Leonia's history, Mattingly reveals, was its role as an attractive community for artists and writers, many contributors to national magazines, who created a 'suburban' aesthetic. The work done by generations of Leonias' artists provides an important vantage and a wonderful set of tools for exploring evolving notions of suburban culture and landscape, which have broad implications and applications. Oral histories, census records, and the extensive work of Leonia's many artists and writers come together to trace not only the community's socially diverse history, but to show how residents viewed the growth and transformation of Leonia as well.</p></p><p>&#34;Mattingly manages the rather neat and absolutely essential trick of keeping broad themes and the richness of local context and detail in view at the same time, shifting effortlessly from one to the other and thus conveying respect for both dimensions.&#34; - Michael H. Frisch<p>Paul H. Mattingly is a professor of history at New York University.</p></p><h2>City of Dreadful Night : A Tale of Horror and the Macabre in India</h2><p>When Lee Siegel went to India to do research for a book on Sanskrit horror literature, a friend in New Delhi told him about an itinerant teller of ghost and vampire tales, a man with clusters of amulets around his neck and a silk top hat with peacock plumes on his head. Siegel set out in search of the old man&#x2014;called Brahm Kathuwala&#x2014;to hear his stories and to learn about his uncommon life. <br><br>But what started out as a study of other people's stories became a compelling story itself. <i>City of Dreadful Night</i> is an astonishing work of fiction, a tangle of tales that transports the reader from the Medieval India of magicians, witches, and vampires, through the British India of Brahm Kathuwala's childhood, into the chaos and political terror of contemporary India. Vividly recreating Indian literary and oral traditions, Siegel weaves a web of possession, reincarnation, and magical transformation unlike any found in the Western tradition. Flesh-eating demons, Rajiv Gandhi's assassin, even Bram Stoker and Dracula populate the serpentine narrative, which intermingles stories about the characters with the terrifying tales they tell.<br><br>Siegel pursues Brahm Kathuwala from the ghastly lights of the cremation ground at Banaras through villages all over north India. Brahm's life story is revealed through countless tales along the way. We learn that he was raised, and abandoned, by two mothers&#x2014;one the destitute floor sweeper who bore him; the other her employer, a wealthy Irish woman who read and reread to him the story of Dracula. We hear of his marriage to the daughter of a cremation ground attendant, his battles against her demonic possession, and their painful parting. We come to understand the daily life and motivations of this "horror professional," who uses terrifying tales to ward off the evil he himself fears.<br><br>This unorthodox book is more than a story; it blends scholarship, fantasy, travelogue, and autobiography&#x2014;fusing and overlapping historical accounts and newscasts, literary texts and films, dreams and nocturnal tales. Siegel uses imagination to explore the relation of real terror to horror fiction and to contemplate the ways fear and disgust become thrilling elements in stories of the macabre. <br><br>This book is the product of Siegel's deep knowledge of both Indian and Western literary and philosophical traditions. It is also an attempt to come to grips with the omnipresence of political and religious terror in contemporary India. Shocking, original, beautifully written, <i>City of Dreadful Night</i> offers readers a captivating immersion in the wonder and terror of India, past and present.</p><p>Lee Siegel is a professional magician and professor of religion at the University of Hawaii. His first novel is a succulent treat for horror readers. In an exuberantly described setting of India in all her violent wonders, we travel with an itinerant storyteller who wears a garland of animal skulls, a silver crucifix, and a battered English top hat adorned with peacock feathers. Here are stories within stories, starting even on the jacket copy, which claims Siegel went to India to research a book on Sanskrit horror literature and then, on the recommendation of a friend, traveled to Varanasi, City of Dreadful Night, to look for the aforementioned old storyteller--and so on into the tale. Vikram ChandraVikram Chandra writes in the <i>New York Times</i> that the book is "structurally complicated, gruesome, satisfyingly full of harmonies with other tales and illustrative of a variety of Indian responses to life's inexplicable catastrophes."City of Dreadful Night is an astonishing work of fiction, a tangle of tales that transports the reader from the Medieval India of magicians, witches, and vampires, through the British colonial period with its culture clashes and simmering unrest, into the chaos and political terror of contemporary India. Flesh-eating demons, Rajiv Gandhi&#39;s assassin, even Bram Stoker and Dracula populate the serpentine narrative, which intermingles stories about the characters with the terrifying tales they tell. At the heart of the book is an itinerant teller of ghost tales called Brahm Kathuwala, an old man wearing amulets around his neck and a silk top hat with peacock plumes. As Siegel follows him all over north India, Brahm&#39;s life story is revealed through countless interlocking tales. We learn of his two mothers - one the destitute floor sweeper who bore him; the other a wealthy Irish woman who read and reread to him the story of Dracula.

Instead of trying to unravel the riddle of a mythical entity called the mind, Szasz suggests that our task should be to understand and judge persons always as moral agents responsible for their own actions, not as victims of brain chemistry. This is Szasz's most ambitious work to date. In his best-selling book, <i>The Myth of Mental Illness</i>, he took psychiatry to task for misconstruing human conflict and coping as mental illness. In <i>Our Right to Drugs</i>, he exposed the irrationality and political opportunism that fuels the Drug War. In <i>The Meaning of Mind</i>, he warns that we misconstrue the dialogue within as a problem of consciousness and neuroscience, and do so at our own peril.</p><p></p><p>In <i>The Meaning of Mind</i>, Thomas Szasz argues that only as a verb does the word mind mean something in the real world, namely, attending or heeding. Minding is the ability to pay attention and adapt to one's environment by using language to communicate with others and oneself. Viewing the mind as a potentially infinite variety of self-conversations is the key that unlocks many of the mysteries we associate with this concept. Modern neuroscience is a misdirected effort to explain mind in terms of brain functions. The claims and conclusions of the diverse academics and scientists who engage in this enterprise undermine the concepts of moral agency and personal responsibility. Szasz shows that the cognitive function of speech is to enable us to talk not only to others but to ourselves (in short, to be our own interlocutor), and that the view that mind is brain&#x2015;embraced by both the scientific community and the popular press&#x2015;is not an empirical finding but a rhetorical ruse concealing humanity's unceasing struggle to control persons by controlling the vocabulary. The discourse of brain-mind, unlike the discourse of man as moral agent, protects people from the dilemmas intrinsic to holding themselves responsible for their own actions and holding others responsible for theirs. Because we live in an age blessed by the fruits of materialist science, reductionist explanations of the relationship between brain and mind are more popular today than ever, making this book an indispensible addition to the seemingly recondite debate about, simply, who we are.</p></p><p><p>In this brilliantly original and highly accessible work, Szasz demonstrates the futility of analyzing the mind as a collection of brain functions. Instead of trying to unravel the riddle of a mythical entity called the mind, Szasz puts forth that our task should be to understand and judge persons as moral agents, not as victims of brain chemistry.</p>Szasz here addresses the concept of mind with his customary fervor. Clear, provocative, and based on broad reading and experience...the argument...concludes with the assertion of &#39;the conceptual primacy of the person as moral agent.&#39; Szasz upholds this primacy against its reduction to the mind by psychiatry, to the soul by religion, or to the body by neuroscience....Recommended for academic libraries.</p><h2>The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare (The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare 2 Volume Hardback Set) (Volume 1)</h2><p>Warfare was the single biggest preoccupation of historians in antiquity. In recent decades fresh textual interpretations, numerous new archaeological discoveries and a much broader analytical focus emphasising social, economic, political and cultural approaches have transformed our understanding of ancient warfare. Volume I of this two-volume History reflects these developments and provides a systematic account, written by a distinguished cast of contributors, of the various themes underlying the warfare of the Greek world from the Archaic to the Hellenistic period and of Early and Middle Republican Rome. For each broad period developments in troop-types, equipment, strategy and tactics are discussed. These are placed in the broader context of developments in international relations and the relationship of warfare to both the state and wider society. Numerous illustrations, a glossary and chronology, and information about the authors mentioned supplement the text.

In Free Market Revolution, the keepers of Ayn Rand&#39;s legacy argue that the answer lies in her pioneering philosophy of capitalism and self-interest -a philosophy that more and more people are turning to for answers. In the past few years, Rand&#39;s works have surged to new peaks of popularity, as politicians like Paul Ryan, media figures like John Stossel, and businessmen like John Mackey routinely name her as one of their chief influences. Here, Brook and Watkins explain how her ideas can solve a host of political and economic ills, including the debt crisis, inflation, overregulation, and the swelling welfare</p><p><p><b>Yaron Brook </b>is Executive Director of the Ayn Rand Institute.

Yaron Brook and Don Watkins meld philosophy with practicality in their cogent analysis of how Ayn Rand's moral defense of capitalism can bring down the limitless growth of government and restore its original, intended purpose--protection of individual rights. Changing the trajectory of the country calls for a long and intense fight with very steep odds against victory. But the concept of the <i>Free Market Revolution</i>, celebrating the individual pursuit of rational, long-term self interest as a virtue, provides the arsenal for the assault. And Brook and Watkins give a battle plan of surefire approaches to limit, and then eliminate, even such massive incursions as the government's takeover of healthcare.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jim M. Kilts, Former CEO of Gillette Company</i></p><p>&#x201c;The most important issue in our society today is the morality of capitalism. <i>Free Market Revolution</i> lays bare how capitalism is the only economic system consistent with man's nature as a thinking being who must act in his long term rational self-interest to survive and prosper. This is an important book which integrates philosophical ideas with their real world consequences.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John A. Allison, Retired Chairman &amp; CEO, BB&amp;T Corporation</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Free Market Revolution: How Ayn Rand's Ideas Can End Big Government</i> is very welcomed indeed.

It recounts the rollicking adventures of the members of the Pickwick Club as they travel about England getting into all sorts of mischief. Laugh-out-loud funny and endlessly entertaining, the book also reveals Dickens&#39;s burgeoning interest in the parliamentary system, lawyers, the Poor Laws, and the ills of debtors&#39; prisons. As G. K. Chesterton noted, &#34;Before [Dickens] wrote a single real story, he had a kind of vision . . . a map full of fantastic towns, thundering coaches, clamorous market-places, uproarious inns, strange and swaggering figures.

The near collapse of the U.S. financial system in 2008&#x2013;2009, political paralysis that has blocked effective policymaking, and emerging competitors such as the Chinese renminbi have heightened speculation about the dollar&#x2019;s looming displacement as the main reserve currency. Yet, as <i>The Dollar Trap</i> powerfully argues, the financial crisis, a dysfunctional international monetary system, and U.S. policies have paradoxically strengthened the dollar&#x2019;s importance.</p><p>Eswar Prasad examines how the dollar came to have a central role in the world economy and demonstrates that it will remain the cornerstone of global finance for the foreseeable future. Marshaling a range of arguments and data, and drawing on the latest research, Prasad shows why it will be difficult to dislodge the dollar-centric system. With vast amounts of foreign financial capital locked up in dollar assets, including U.S. government securities, other countries now have a strong incentive to prevent a dollar crash.</p><p>Prasad takes the reader through key contemporary issues in international finance&#x2015;including the growing economic influence of emerging markets, the currency wars, the complexities of the China-U.S. relationship, and the role of institutions like the International Monetary Fund&#x2015;and offers new ideas for fixing the flawed monetary system. Readers are also given a rare look into some of the intrigue and backdoor scheming in the corridors of international finance.</p><p><i>The Dollar Trap</i> offers a panoramic analysis of the fragile state of global finance and makes a compelling case that, despite all its flaws, the dollar will remain the ultimate safe-haven currency.</p></p><p><p>"As Eswar Prasad points out, there is something paradoxical about a world where the dollar strengthens with the U.S. financial crisis, capital flows from poor countries to rich ones, and more sophisticated finance often leads to greater risk. Prasad's book unpacks these paradoxes in a provocative and challenging way. It deserves the attention of all those who care about the future of the dollar and the international monetary system."<b>--Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Combining history, modern analysis, and practical examples, this elegant book counters conventional wisdom and brilliantly documents why it's so hard to escape the dollar trap. Prasad describes an increasingly unstable equilibrium that begs for better international policy coordination and he sets out fascinating and important alternatives that will particularly interest policymakers and investors. A must-read for all concerned about the dollar's global role."<b>--Mohamed A. El-Erian, author of <i>When Markets Collide</i> and CEO of PIMCO</b></p><p>"At a time when the global repercussions of U.S. monetary policy are being closely examined, <i>The Dollar Trap</i> takes an authoritative look at the dollar's role in the international economy. The discussion of capital flows and the historical rise and fall of reserve currencies provides insights into the turbulent post-financial-crisis era and serves as a roadmap for thinking about the dollar's future. A must-read for anyone interested in how the wheels of international finance spin."<b>--Carmen M. Reinhart, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Prasad tackles one of the toughest and most important implications of the 2008 financial crisis--the exorbitant privilege that has long been accorded the almighty U.S. dollar as the world's dominant reserve currency. While he argues convincingly that this status is unlikely to change in the years immediately ahead, he plants seeds that make the reader ponder when--not if--the dominant role of the greenback might start to change."<b>--Stephen Roach, Yale University and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia</b></p><p>"This book makes a compelling case against the conventional wisdom that the dollar's dominance is drawing to an end. Prasad provides an elegantly written and provocative account of the various paradoxes that beset the global financial system, and shows how the United States holds many trump cards that will secure the dollar's primacy for a long time to come."<b>--Nouriel Roubini, coauthor of <i>Crisis Economics</i></b></p><p>"Giving an insightful look at a problematic international monetary system, <i>The Dollar Trap</i> draws conclusions that may comfort some but disturb others. To those caught in the trap there remains a strong desire to find a safe way out. The guardians of the dollar should have the time and the political will to act, in order to demonstrate that this is all unnecessary."<b>--Joseph Yam, former chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority</b></p><p>"Scholarly and yet eminently readable, this outstanding book should be compulsory reading for Indian policymakers, market participants, and all those concerned with the Indian economy. I fully endorse the masterly analysis, clear conclusions, and elegant articulation in this book on a subject critical for India's future. This provocative, informative, and incisive book fills a huge void in our understanding of the future of the dollar and indeed of the global economy."<b>--Yaga Venugopal Reddy, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India</b></p><p>"Adopting a contrarian view to the idea that the dollar's role as a global reserve currency will diminish, <i>The Dollar Trap</i> makes a compelling argument for the continuing relevance of the dollar even in the wake of the global economic dynamics witnessed after 2008 and the rise of emerging markets. Dr. Prasad makes an important contribution to the discussion on the international monetary order. I am sure this book will be of great interest to anyone wanting to understand the forces shaping the global economy, trade, and financial markets."<b>--Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank</b></p><b>Eswar S.

Exhibited at the Palace of the Popes in Avignon in 1970, they were a highlight of the year on the international art scene. Reproduced in this handsome volume, they are dramatic evidence of Picasso&#39;s inexhaustible technical prowess and exuberant creative powers. All the paintings are shown in full color - each colorplate carefully supervised by Picasso himself to ensure the utmost fidelity to the original - and are accompanied by a group of related drawings in duotone. The subjects are light-hearted, sometimes erotic improvisations, inventions, and variations that reflect the artist&#39;s joie de vivre and ebullient spirits. Taking a cue from the paintings, Rafael Alberti, one of the leading figures in the modern renaissance of Spanish letters, weaves a joyous fantasy of his own. Speaking as and for the characters in the paintings, he pays enchantingly funny yet deeply touching homage to his old friend.&#34;</p><p>Text: English, French, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>Mergers and Acquisitions from A to Z</h2><p>"The power your company can generate in concert with another is immense.

He is the author of The Masks of Orthodoxy: Folk Gravestone Carvings in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, 1689-1805, Old-Town and the Waterside, and Charles Delin: Port Painter of Maastricht and Amsterdam.Many people think of family history and genealogical research as the collection and preservation of dry facts about our ancestors. That's true, to some extent, but what sort of artifacts did our ancestors create to commemorate their loved ones and what can we gain by studying them? Simons (New England Historic Genealogical Society) and Benes (Dublin Seminar for New England Folklife), together with a who's who of scholarly contributors, demonstrate that a great deal can be learned from the things our ancestors left behind. The essays are divided into sections that highlight the popularity, varieties, and significance of family registers, family-tree lithographs, portraitures, gravestones and epitaphs, mourning jewelry, and silver pieces of New England in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Through the examination of these artifacts it becomes clear that our ancestors desired not only to preserve genealogical data but also to declare their love and devotion and perpetuate their memories of family. This book provides a solid foundation for social historians, genealogists with New England roots, or those with an interest in decorative arts of the era.

One of the leaders of the Jewish Fighting Organization, which led the uprisings, was Yitzhak Zuckerman, known by his underground pseudonym, Antek. Decades later, living in Israel, Antek dictated his memoirs. The Hebrew publication of <i>Those Seven Years: 1939-1946</i> was a major event in the historiography of the Holocaust, and now Antek's memoirs are available in English.<br><br>Unlike Holocaust books that focus on the annihilation of European Jews, Antek's account is of the daily struggle to maintain human dignity under the most dreadful conditions. His passionate, involved testimony, which combines detail, authenticity, and gripping immediacy, has unique historical importance. The memoirs situate the ghetto and the resistance in the social and political context that preceded them, when prewar Zionist and Socialist youth movements were gradually forged into what became the first significant armed resistance against the Nazis in all of occupied Europe. Antek also describes the activities of the resistance after the destruction of the ghetto, when 20,000 Jews hid in "Aryan" Warsaw and then participated in illegal immigration to Palestine after the war.<br><br>The only extensive document by any Jewish resistance leader in Europe, Antek's book is central to understanding ghetto life and underground activities, Jewish resistance under the Nazis, and Polish-Jewish relations during and after the war. This extraordinary work is a fitting monument to the heroism of a people.</p><p>In 1943, against utterly hopeless odds, the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto rose up to defy the Nazi horror machine that had set out to exterminate them.

Would Apollo be the right man at the helm of Acme Widget? What sweeping changes would Athena make if she controlled an ad agency? While this might merely seem like an entertaining concept, it also happens to be<br>an extremely valuable framework for understanding management styles and the corporate cultures associated with them.<br><br>In The Gods of Management, best-selling author Charles Handy uses four Greek gods to illustrate for managers the basic approaches they can use in their own businesses. When power radiates throughout the company from a top boss, that would be an example of a Zeus or "club" organization, one that<br>investment banks and brokerage firms often adopt for their corporate climates. An Apollo "role" culture, on the other hand, results in a stable bureaucracy, such as a life insurance company or a firm with a long history of success with a single product. The Athena "task" environment emphasizes<br>talent, youth, and team problem-solving, as we'd find in ad agencies and consultancies. And lastly, a Dionysius "existential" design exists to let individuals achieve their purposes, as in a university or group medical practice.<br><br>In this thought-provoking volume, Charles Handy shows managers how to be aware of the cultural choices they can make to create a more productive and satisfying workplace.</p><p>In &#39;Gods of Management, &#39; best-selling author Charles Handy uses four Greek gods to illustrate for managers the basic approaches they can use in their own businesses.<br><strong>Charles Handy</strong> is a Fellow of the London Business School.

There's also a vital and continuing tradition of women's reform that sought social as well as individual rights and argued for the dismantling of the masculine standard. In this much anticipated book, Dorothy Sue Cobble retrieves the forgotten feminism of the previous generations of working women, illuminating the ideas that inspired them and the reforms they secured from employers and the state. This socially and ethnically diverse movement for change emerged first from union halls and factory floors and spread to the "pink collar" domain of telephone operators, secretaries, and airline hostesses. From the 1930s to the 1980s, these women pursued answers to problems that are increasingly pressing today: how to balance work and family and how to address the growing economic inequalities that confront us. <i>The Other Women's Movement</i> traces their impact from the 1940s into the feminist movement of the present.</p><br><p> The labor reformers whose stories are told in <i>The Other Women's Movement</i> wanted equality and "special benefits," and they did not see the two as incompatible. They argued that gender differences must be accommodated and that "equality" could not always be achieved by applying an identical standard of treatment to men and women. The reform agenda they championed--an end to unfair sex discrimination, just compensation for their waged labor, and the right to care for their families and communities--launched a revolution in employment practices that carries on today.</p><br><p> Unique in its range and perspective, this is the first book to link the continuous tradition of social feminism to the leadership of labor women within that movement.</p></p><p>Winner of the 28th Annual 2005 Philip Taft Labor History Award, International Association of Labour History Institutions Honorable Mention for the 2004 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award, Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights One of Choice&#39;s Outstanding Academic Titles for 2004.<p>"The book is a tour de force of historical analysis. <i>The Other Women's Movement</i> pursues the very ambitious goal of reconstructing the historical relationship between feminism and working women in the United States between 1930 and 1980. The book brilliantly achieves this goal."<b>--Kathryn Kish Sklar, Binghamton University</b></p></p><h2>Faith in a Seed: The Dispersion Of Seeds And Other Late Natural History Writings</h2><p>Faith in a Seed contains the hitherto unpublished work The Dispersion of Seeds, one of Henry D. Thoreau's last important research and writing projects, and now his first new book to appear in 125 years.With the remarkable clarity and grace that characterize all of his writings, Thoreau describes the ecological succession of plant species through seed dispersal. <i>The Dispersion of Seeds</i>, which draws on Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, refutes the then widely accepted theory that some plants spring spontaneously to life, independent of roots, cuttings, or seeds. As Thoreau wrote: "Though I do not believe a plant will spring up where no seed has been, I have great faith in a seed. Convince me that you have a seed there, and I am prepared to expect wonders." Henry D. Thoreau's <i>Faith in a Seed</i>, was first published in hardcover in 1993 by Island Press under the Shearwater Books imprint, which unifies scientific views of nature with humanistic ones. This important work, the first publication of Thoreau's last manuscript, is now available in paperback. <i>Faith in a Seed</i> contains Thoreau's last important research and writing project, <i>The Dispersion of Seeds</i>, along with other natural history writings from late in his life. Edited by Bradley P. Dean, professor of English at East Carolina University and editor of the Thoreau Society Bulletin, these writings demonstrate how a major American author at the height of his career succeeded in making science and literature mutually enriching.</p><p>Gary Paul Nabhan is an internationally celebrated nature writer, food and farming activist, and proponent of conserving the links between biodiversity and cultural diversity. He has been been honored as a pioneer and creative force in the &#x201c;local food movement&#x201d; and seed saving community by <i>Utne Reader</i>, <i>Mother Earth News</i>, <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Bioneers</i>, and <i>Time </i>magazine. <br> As the W.K. Kellogg Endowed Chair in Sustainable Food Systems at the University of Arizona Southwest Center, he works with students, faculty and non-profits to build a more just, nutritious, sustainable, and climate-resilient foodshed spanning the U.S./Mexico border. He was among the earliest researchers to promote the use of native foods in preventing diabetes, especially in his role as a co-founder and researcher with Native Seeds/SEARCH. Gary is also personally engaged as an orchard-keeper, wild foods forager, and pollinator habitat restorationist working from his small farm in Patagonia, Arizona near the Mexican border. He has helped forge &#x201c;the radical center&#x201d; for collaborative conservation among farmers, ranchers, indigenous peoples and environmentalists in the West. He played key roles in establishing the Ironwood Forest National Monument, community-based seed banks, land reserves for conserving wild crop relatives, and restored habitats for migratory pollinators throughout the West.<br> Agricultural historian Peter Hatch of Monticello has called Nabhan &#x201c;the lyrical scholar of genetic diversity.&#x201d; As an Arab-American essayist and poet, he is author or editor of twenty-four books, some of which have been translated into Arabic, Spanish, Italian, French, Croation, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. For his creative writing and its influence on community-based conservation, he has been honored with a MacArthur &#x201c;genius&#x201d; award, a Lannan Literary Fellowship, a Southwest Book Award, the John Burroughs Medal for nature writing, the Vavilov Medal, and several honorary degrees and lifetime achievement awards.<br> He works most of the year as a research scientist at Tumamoc Hill and the Southwest Center of the University of Arizona, but he is also engaged with several food justice and farming alliances, including Sabores Sin Fronteras, Santa Cruz Valley Heritage Alliance, Wild Farm Alliance, Renewing America&#x2019;s Food Traditions, and the Borderlands Habitat Restoration Initiative. Nabhan is humbled and honored to serve as a professed Ecumenical Franciscan brother, helping the Franciscan Action Network in shaping ethical responses to environmental injustice, to immigration issues, and to climate change.<br> &nbsp;For Thoreauvians, botanists, agriculturalists, and scholars of 19th-century America, this book represents nothing less than a triumph of editorial skill and integrity over conventional wisdom. A study of plant ecology using Darwinian theory, Faith in a Seed is one of the more interesting books published in our time, so felicitously does it give readers a fresh dose of all that makes Thoreau such a major figure in American letters. The holograph of The Dispersion of Seeds , Thoreau's last major project (as well as the manuscript of Wild Fruits, selections of which appear here along with two other writings probably intended for the title volume) was dismissed by most of the scholars who even knew of it as being taxonomically suspect, uninterestingly concrete, and "best left unpublished." How wrong. It is, in fact, the book that latter-day Thoreau admirers have often wished he had written: sensual, acute, intricate, and altogether fascinating, a text that should cause scholars to reevaluate their assessment of an important writer. A fundamental acquisition for all collections.<br><i>- Mark L.

Dahl seems to know just how far to go with his oddball fantasies; in <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,</i> for example, nasty Violet Beauregarde blows up into a blueberry from sneaking forbidden chewing gum, and bratty Augustus Gloop is carried away on the river of chocolate he wouldn't resist. In fact, all manner of disasters can happen to the most obnoxiously deserving of children because Dahl portrays each incident with such resourcefulness and humor. <p> <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> is a singular delight, crammed with mad fantasy, childhood justice and revenge, and as much candy as you can eat. The book is also available in Spanish (<i>Charlie y la Fabrica de Chocolate</i>).

Challenging prohibition by following the Scripture to the last letter, they were condemned as heretics. The Waldensians constituted the only medieval heresy to have survived to the dawn of the so-called &#34;modern&#34; period.

The Catholic Historical Review</p><h2>Aristotle&#39;s Ethics: Writings from the Complete Works - Revised Edition</h2><p><p>Aristotle's moral philosophy is a pillar of Western ethical thought. It bequeathed to the world an emphasis on virtues and vices, happiness as well-being or a life well lived, and rationally motivated action as a mean between extremes. Its influence was felt well beyond antiquity into the Middle Ages, particularly through the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. In the past century, with the rise of virtue theory in moral philosophy, Aristotle&#x2019;s ethics has been revived as a source of insight and interest. While most attention has traditionally focused on Aristotle&#x2019;s famous<i> Nicomachean Ethics</i>, there are several other works written by or attributed to Aristotle that illuminate his ethics: the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, the <i>Magna Moralia</i>, and <i>Virtues and Vices.</i></p><p>This book brings together all four of these important texts, in thoroughly revised versions of the translations found in the authoritative complete works universally recognized as the standard English edition. Edited and introduced by two of the world&#x2019;s leading scholars of ancient philosophy, this is an essential volume for anyone interested in the ethical thought of one of the most important philosophers in the Western tradition.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan Barnes</b> taught at the universities of Oxford, Geneva, and Paris-Sorbonne.

Particularly well-known for his work in popularizing the &#x201c;universe story&#x201d; and exploring the religious implications of the new cosmology, Berry pointed the way to a spirituality attuned to our place in the natural world, and an ethic of responsibility and care for the earth. This work, timed to mark the centenary of his birth, will offer the best guide to one of the true prophets and spiritual masters of our time.</p><p>Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim were students of Thomas Berry and have devoted themselves to his legacy.

It presents a selection of correspondence, from his adolescence in the 1930s through the height of his career and up to the last years of his life, covering such topics as friendships, intellectual adventures, politics, and aesthetics. It offers an intimate look at Barthes's thought processes and the everyday reflection behind the composition of his works, as well as a rich archive of epistolary friendships, spanning half a century, among the leading intellectuals of the day.<br><br>Barthes was one of the great observers of language and culture, and <i>Album</i> shows him in his element, immersed in heady French intellectual culture and the daily struggles to maintain a writing life. Barthes's correspondents include Maurice Blanchot, Michel Butor, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Julia Kristeva, Claude L�vi-Strauss, Georges Perec, Raymond Queneau, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Marthe Robert, and Jean Starobinski, among others. The book also features documents, letters, and postcards reproduced in facsimile; unpublished material; and notes and transcripts from his seminars. The first English-language publication of Barthes's letters, <i>Album</i> is a comprehensive testimony to one of the most influential critics and philosophers of the twentieth century and the world of letters in which he lived and breathed.</p><p>Roland Barthes (1915&#x2013;1980) was a French literary theorist, philosopher, critic, and semiotician.

This new glimpse into a celebrated career will be rewarding to Barthes scholars. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>This wonderful book locates the elusive Roland Barthes&#x2015;the very notion hints at its impossibility&#x2015;in his various worlds: in the sanatorium, in literary and academic Paris, in the long escapade of structuralism and after. It succeeds in this attempt not by trying to define him but by allowing him to place himself among his friends and his books, among his colleagues and his projects. One of his dreams, he said, was &#x2018;to disappear and still be close by.&#x2019; Here we begin to see how he managed to do just that. (Michael Wood, Princeton University)<br><br>Roland Barthes was my friend since 1957, though I&#x2019;ve never had a friend whose offering exacted so little from anyone and so richly fulfilled the rewards of our intimacy&#x2015;except for the pleasure of Roland&#x2019;s texts, that are now beyond mourning. <br> Roland arranged to take his mother and me from Paris to New York in the mid 1960s&#x2015;her first visit since 1904 and her first air travel to the newly named Kennedy Airport, landing on top of a city Madame Barthes could never have imagined from her first encounter with it, and from then on everything was all pleasure. Moreover my discovery that his mother did not read his texts, and that Roland did not expect her to, eased some family tensions of my own.<br> Roland was faithful to what Walter Pater, whom he had never heard of, calls &#x201c;the administration of the visible&#x201d;, for Roland adored the physical world: &#x201c;Desire still irritates the non-will-to-possess by this perilous movement. I love you in my head, but imprison you behind my lips. I do not divulge.

(Callie Gardner <i>H-France</i>)</p><h2>A FORTRAN Coloring Book</h2><p>"The right way to read a FORTRAN book," the author of this one tells us now that we've read <i>his</i> almost to its last page, "is by a series of skimming passes. Each time through you pick up a bit more of the nitty-gritty detail. When you pick up an IBM manual, for instance, first flip through it looking for the jokes. There aren't any, so go back and flip through again, getting familiar with the overall idea. Then flip through from back to front, side to side, and top to bottom. If there's a centerfold, you're in the wrong publication! Each time through, you'll be looking for specific details connected with whatever you are doing at the time on the computer. After a while, the whole works will have seeped through your skin by osmosis." This introduction to FORTRAN works like that, squared. Or unsquared. Anyway, it's unlike any technical manual or textbook you've ever seen. You may <i>think</i> you're chuckling knowingly at some felicitous irreverence the author has craftily inserted, or gravely pondering a remark by one of his cartoon animals, or groaning over an especially outrageous pun. You may even think you're just coloring the giraffe yellow. But you're <i>really</i> learning FORTRAN&#x2014;how to use it, how to keep it from using you&#x2014;on the sly. High school kids can deal with it. The book will also appeal to, like, college sophomores, since it revels in a brand of collegiate humor that is just not going to go away, that is going to last&#x2014;alas&#x2014;through generations of computers. And sophomores, nowadays, are finding that FORTRAN is more often a prerequisite or academic requirement than is, oh, French, just to mention another popular modern language.<br> <br> The book teaches its readers all they need to know to get a start at programming real computers about such things as algorithms, the arithmetic "if," array storage, artichokes, assignment statements, branches, bugs (including those in programs), "call" statements, complex constants, conditional branches, control statements, dimension statements, "do" loops, dummy arguments, errors, exponential notation, floating point numbers, floormats, the Gauss-Seidel method, "go-to" statements, hierarchy, integer field specifications, Kaufman, line printers, logical assignment statements, mixed modes, nested implied "do" loops, parentheses, prunes, "read" statements, recursion relations, relational operators, specification statements, Spiro Whatsisname, storage, subprograms, "type" statements, unary and ornery operators, "write" statements, X-field specifications, and you-can't-get-there-from-here statements.<br> <br> That's not all, folks, and not in that order. Like any good book that's not a dictionary, this one is ordered in a functional rather than alphabetical way, but some of these topics think they deserve top billing, so...<br> <br> Roger Kaufman first tried out his coloring book in a course he taught to MIT freshmen. They liked it just fine, and said so in their "formal course evaluation." They probably learned FORTRAN better&#x2014;more accurately, more memorably&#x2014;than they would have from some stuffy text.<br> <br> Dr. Kaufman wrote the book. I mean, he <i>wrote</i> it, the actual words you see, with a pen. He also drew the pictures, diagrams, flow charts, and things.</p><p></p><h2>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</h2><p>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl is a slave narrative that was published in 1861 by Harriet Ann Jacobs, using the pen name "Linda Brent." The book is an in-depth chronological account of Jacobs's life as a slave, and the decisions and choices she made to gain freedom for herself and her children. It addresses the struggles and sexual abuse that young women slaves faced on the plantations, and how these struggles were harsher than what men suffered as slaves. The book is considered sentimental and written to provoke an emotional response and sympathy from the reader toward slavery in general and slave women in particular[citation needed] for their struggles with rape, the pressure to have sex at an early age, the selling of their children, and the treatment of female slaves by their mistresses.Jacobs began composing Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl while living and working at Idlewild, the Hudson River home of writer and publisher Nathaniel Parker Willis, who was fictionalized in the book as Mr. Bruce. Portions of the book were published in serial form in the New-York Tribune, owned and edited by Horace Greeley. Jacobs's reports of sexual abuse were considered too shocking to the average newspaper reader of the day, and publication ceased before the completion of the narrative.Boston publishing house Phillips and Samson agreed to print the work in book form if Jacobs could convince Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe to provide a preface. She refused to ask Willis for help and Stowe turned her down, though the Phillips and Samson company closed anyway. She eventually managed to sign an agreement with the Thayer &amp; Eldridge publishing house and they requested a preface by Lydia Maria Child. Child also edited the book and the company introduced her to Jacobs. The two women remained in contact for much of their remaining lives. Thayer &amp; Eldridge, however, declared bankruptcy before the narrative could be published.</p><p>Jacobs (1813-97) was a slave in North Carolina and suffered terribly, along with her family, at the hands of a ruthless owner. She made several failed attempts to escape before successfully making her way North, though it took years of hiding and slow progress. Eventually, she was reunited with her children.</p><h2>Contemporary Urban Planning</h2><p><p>Planning is a highly political activity. It is immersed in politics and inseparable from the law.

It emphasizes the experience of worshippers, considering Greek religious practice from a variety of perspectives from that of the slave and members of the family, to that of priests and public officials.

Thoreau</h2><p><p>It was his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson, another inveterate journal keeper, who urged Thoreau to keep a record of his thoughts and observations. Begun in 1837, Thoreau&#x2019;s journal spans a period of twenty-five years and runs to more than two million words, coming to a halt only in 1861, shortly before the author&#x2019;s death. The handwritten journal had somewhat humble origins, but as it grew in scope and ambition it came to function as a record of Thoreau&#x2019;s interior life as well as the source for his books and essays. Indeed, it became the central concern of the author&#x2019;s literary life. Critics now recognize Thoreau&#x2019;s journal as an important artistic achievement in its own right.</p><p>Making selections from the entirety of the journal, Cramer presents all aspects of Thoreau: writer, thinker, naturalist, social reformer, neighbor, friend. No other single-volume edition offers such a full picture of Thoreau&#x2019;s life and work. Cramer&#x2019;s annotations add to the reader&#x2019;s enjoyment and understanding. He provides notes on the biographical, historical, and geographical contexts of Thoreau&#x2019;s life. The relation between Journal passages and the texts of works published in the author&#x2019;s lifetime receive special emphasis. A companion to <i>Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition</i>, this gift edition of the Journal will be dipped into and treasured, and it makes a welcome addition to any book lover&#x2019;s library.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Jeffrey S.

As he tells the story of this once rich, now mostly empty landscape, Manning also describes a grand vision for ecological restoration, currently being set in motion, that would establish a prairie preserve larger than Yellowstone National Park, flush with wild bison, elk, bears, and wolves. Taking us to an isolated stretch of central Montana along the upper Missouri River, Manning peels back the layers of history and discovers how key elements of the American story&#x2014;conservation, the New Deal, progressivism, the yeoman myth, and the idea of private property&#x2014;have collided with and shaped this incomparable landscape. An account of great loss, <i>Rewilding the West </i>also holds out the promise of resurrection&#x2014;but rather than remake the plains once again, Manning proposes that we now find the wisdom to let the prairies remake us.</p><p>Manning strips away layers of western myth to tell a story of bad intentions made good, good intentions gone bad, and a wild hope that has endured through decades of ecological trauma. Every word is grounded in a fierce respect for the grasslands of the Missouri Breaks and the opportunity they represent for a radical revisioning of the wild west.&#x201d; Candace Savage, author of <i>Prairie: a Natural History</i><br><br> <i>Rewilding the West</i> accurately and incisively sums up the interwoven story of American agriculture policies, public lands management, and conservation. Richard Manning also points toward positive possibilities in our future. Anyone interested in these matters (most of us in the West) needs to come to terms with his sometimes highly opinionated but ultimately well-reasoned arguments.&#x201d; William Kittredge, author of <i>Who Owns the West</i> and <i>The Willow Field</i><b>Richard Manning </b>is an award-winning environmental author and journalist.

Its psychologically disturbing presentation of an aggressive, designing woman and a reluctant husband wooed by trickery won it little favour in earlier centuries, and both directors and critics have frequently tried to avoid or simplify its uncomfortable elements.

Rooted in the flavors and techniques of Italian regional cooking, these recipes include inventive hits like fennel-crusted pork chops; meatballs with ricotta, tomato, greens, and preserved lemon; and agnolotti made with cacao pasta dough. Irresistible desserts such as apple cider donuts and a chocolate budino tart, from co-owner and pastry chef Genevieve Gergis, end the concert of flavors on a high note.

I&#x2019;m not Italian, but I&#x2019;ve long identified with the festive, loud, communal style of eating that&#x2019;s particular to the Italian table. And since my earliest days as a chef, I&#x2019;ve somehow had an instinctual understanding of how to work with Italian flavors. They just feel familiar. Not that I haven&#x2019;t wanted to try other things. During the ten years I spent working in Italian restaurants, I had many opportunities to cook with acclaimed chefs from France and Japan. But somehow, in every case, Italian food drew me back in and it has never let me go.<br><br>Bestia&#x2019;s food has its roots in the flavors of Italy. Most of our dishes draw inspiration from some traditional recipe, and we share the very Italian approach of showcasing the best of what&#x2019;s local, fresh, and seasonal. From there, though, the Italian influence stops. Instead, we look beyond any formal culinary style&#x2014;to our own life experiences, our travels, and daily influences&#x2014;to create dishes that are wholly original and wholly us.<br><br>For example, the Pineapple Mostarda alongside our Grilled Pork Porterhouse is a salute to the <i>al pastor </i>trucks cruising LA after midnight. Our Charred Shishito Peppers with Squid Ink Aioli derives its flavor profile from Spain, one of our favorite places to travel. If you pick up the aroma of fig leaves in our lamb ragu, look to the giant fig tree shading Bestia&#x2019;s front patio to know why. And the base of creamy yogurt beneath our lamb belly confit reminds me a little of the kebabs I grew up eating in Israel. More than any geographic region or culinary canon, the foods of Bestia are a reflection of our combined life experiences and, more important, our desire to extract the most flavor we can from the highest-quality ingredients.<br><br>Everything we serve at Bestia is designed to achieve maximum &#x201c;craveability.&#x201d; I want you to take one bite of a dish and then feel compelled to have another one. And then another one. I think, &#x201c;How can I make you to want to taste this again and again and again, no matter how full you are?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the same kind of trick that MSG pulls on your brain, but I achieve it organically, through building layer upon layer of natural umami. That&#x2019;s the reason behind our emphasis on dehydrated ingredients, reduced sauces, cured meats, and aged cheeses. Processes like smoking, dehydrating, aging, and fermenting all bring out an ingredient&#x2019;s inherent savoriness. Put one or two&#x2014;or even five&#x2014;elements like that into a dish and you can create something that&#x2019;s completely addictive.<br> <b><br>Genevieve: </b>Our pastry program has the same goal. It&#x2019;s why I love to add savory ingredients like saffron and bay leaves and herbs and cheeses to my desserts. A generous use of salt and bitter elements further help to round out the flavor profile, creating something that&#x2019;s balanced, delicious, and so much more than &#x201c;just sweet.&#x201d;<br><br>But as much as we&#x2019;re about enhancing flavors, we don&#x2019;t want to amplify every ingredient or dish; that can become too much. Instead, we pick one or two key elements to highlight&#x2014;just enough to intrigue the palate but not exhaust it. In the end, it&#x2019;s all about extracting the very best flavor from the very best ingredients. If you want something that&#x2019;s chocolatey, it should be the creamiest chocolatey flavor. Strawberry ice cream should taste like real strawberries.<br> <b><br>Ori: </b>People always ask us, &#x201c;What kind of food is Bestia?&#x201d; But it&#x2019;s so much more about our philosophy and our approach to flavor than any particular style of cooking. We think our recipes included here reflect that.</p><h2>Tools of Navigation: A Kid's Guide to the History &amp; Science of Finding Your Way</h2><p>Children will learn all about inventions: their inventors, the way they changed history, and their evolution over centuries, through the activities and anecdotes provided in this interactive series.&nbsp;Travel through the past and into the future to explore the history of human navigation, from the crude maps of early explorers to the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS)&nbsp;of today.

Easy-to-understand activities, linked directly to the information provided in the text, such as how to make a simple astrolabe, are included in many chapters.

Using straightforward language, this resource traces the history of how humans have attempted to calculate time. Technologies used in modern timekeeping are also included and the coverage of the individuals involved is excellent. The book includes timekeeping history from Asian, African, European, and North and South American cultures. Hands-on activities enhance the understanding of each topic.

We need to realize that we are at war and that the sides have changed radically: many of our former enemies (e.g. Muslims) are now our friends, and some of our former friends (e.g. humanists) are now our enemies. Documenting the spiritual and moral decay that has taken hold of modern society, Kreeft issues a wake-up call to all God-fearing Christian, Jews and Muslims to unite together in a "religious war" against the common enemy of godless secular humanism, materialism and immorality.<br>Aware of the deep theological differences of these monotheistic faiths, Kreeft calls for a moratorium on our polemics against each other so that we can form an alliance to fight together to save western civilization. He cites numerous examples of today's Protestants, Jews, Catholics and Muslims working together to solve moral and spiritual problems. God is calling for this unity, Kreeft says, and if we respond, God will do something wonderful.</p><p>Peter Kreeft is a professor of Philosophy at Boston College.</p><h2>Nurse&#39;s Pocket Guide: Diagnoses, Prioritized Interventions and Rationales</h2><p><p>This pocket size portable reference is the perfect tool for you to use to select the appropriate diagnosis to plan your patient&#x2019;s care effectively.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Herman Melville (1819-91) brought as much genius to the smaller-scale literary forms as he did to the full-blown novel: his poems and the short stories and novellas collected in this volume reveal a deftness and a delicacy of touch that is in some ways even more impressive than the massive, tectonic passions of Moby-Dick. In a story like &#34;Bartleby, the Scrivener&#34; -- one of the very few perfect representatives of the form in the English language -- he displayed an unflinching precision and insight and empathy in his depiction of the drastically alienated inner life of the title character. In &#34;Benito Cereno,&#34; he addressed the great racial dilemmas of the nineteenth century with a profound, almost surreal imaginative clarity. And in Billy, Budd, Sailor, the masterpiece of his last years, he fused the knowledge and craft gained from a lifetime&#39;s magnificent work into a pure, stark, flawlessly composed tale of innocence betrayed and destroyed. Melville is justly honored for the epic sweep of his mind, but his lyricism, his skill in rendering the minute, the particular, the local, was equally sublime.&#34;We are, perhaps, after a century of literary wastelands, able to read not only a personal predicament but a general truth in Melville&#39;s blasted islands, bedevilled slave ships, misshapen houses, falling towers, ticking tables, ghastly factories, sickly cottages, and blank brick city walls. The appetite for truth is what gives Melville&#39;s narratives their persistent interest and, even under the spell of discouragement, their untoward verbal energy ... Like Billy Budd, Melville when a sailor on a man-of-war was a top-man, at home on the highest yards, enjoying the widest view ... Melville instinctively aspired to the grandest scale, and even in his shorter works offers vast inklings and the resonance of cosmic concerns.</p><h2>Learning and Memory: An Integrated Approach</h2><p>From one of the leading researchers in the field of human memory comes the new edition of a truly integrative perspective on learning and memory!

In this revealing autobiography, Schirra takes an inside look at the early days of spaceflight and the men who captured the heart of the nation.</p><p>Four 100-minute tapes.

Schirra jumps around in time and space and repeats himself occasionally, but he convinces his fans that pilots work hard and play hard, and the casual stories of both his professional lives make interesting listening.

Playing many roles--journalist, pamphleteer, novelist, preacher, and advisor on domestic affairs--Stowe used the written word as a vehicle for religious, social, and political commentaries, often leavening them with entertainment in order to reach a broad audience. She had a profound effect on American culture, not because her ideas were unique, but because they were common. What made her so radical was that she insisted on putting her ideas into action. <br> <em>The Oxford Harriet Beecher Stowe Reader</em> offers a focused collection of Stowe's writings from the 1830s through the 1860s. Illustrating her broad range, rhetorical strategies, and cultural designs on the world, it is ideal for courses in nineteenth-century American literature, women's literature, and American history. The volume collects those selections best suited for classroom use, reprinting many pieces here for the first time. Editor Joan D. Hedrick provides a substantial introduction that assesses Stowe's vital impact on nineteenth-century American literature, politics, and culture. The readings are divided into three sections: Early Sketches, Antislavery Writings, and Domestic Culture and Politics. Early Sketches presents the finest writing of Stowe's literary apprenticeship. Antislavery Writings includes <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> in its entirety, placing it in the context of Stowe's considerable and often-overlooked body of other antislavery writings. This section also includes a generous selection from <em>A Key To Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>, a companion volume to the novel. Domestic Culture and Politics shows the scope of Stowe's thinking on the Victorian home, for which she was a major propagandist. The inclusion here of "The True Story of Lady Byron's Life," an expos� of male debauchery and incest at the core of a nineteenth-century home, represents Stowe's willingness to tackle the most challenging political and social issues of her time.<br></p><p>Joan D. Hedrick is at Trinity College, Connecticut.Hedrick&#39;s collection triumphantly balances the radical politicization of Stowe&#39;s writings with the essentially conservative attitude revealed in her writings on house, home and a woman&#39;s sphere Years Work in English Studies</p><h2>The World&#39;s Story 1: The Ancients (Teacher Guide)</h2><p><p>The vital resource that provides all assignments for the <em>The World's Story Volume 1</em> course, which includes:</p> <ul> <li>Materials lists for each chapter, oral and written narration prompts, critical thinking questions, copywork, sketching, map activities, timeline exercises, Dig Deeper research prompts, and other fun projects</li> <li>Review sections, craft suggestions, special project ideas, art and artifact studies, and answer keys</li> </ul> <p>OVERVIEW: Students will learn all about ancient history and civilizations.

Noted historian Earl J. Hess forcefully challenges that claim, offering a new, clear-eyed, and convincing assessment of the rifle musket's actual performance on the battlefield and its impact on the course of the Civil War. <br><br>Many contemporaries were impressed with the new weapon's increased range of 500 yards, compared to the smoothbore musket's range of 100 yards, and assumed that the rifle was a major factor in prolonging the Civil War. Historians have also assumed that the weapon dramatically increased casualty rates, made decisive victories rare, and relegated cavalry and artillery to far lesser roles than they played in smoothbore battles. <br><br>Hess presents a completely new assessment of the rifle musket, contending that its impact was much more limited than previously supposed and was confined primarily to marginal operations such as skirmishing and sniping. He argues further that its potential to alter battle line operations was virtually nullified by inadequate training, soldiers' preference for short-range firing, and the difficulty of seeing the enemy at a distance. He notes that bullets fired from the new musket followed a parabolic trajectory unlike those fired from smoothbores; at mid-range, those rifle balls flew well above the enemy, creating two killing zones between which troops could operate untouched. He also presents the most complete discussion to date of the development of skirmishing and sniping in the Civil War. <br><br>Drawing upon the observations and reflections of the soldiers themselves, Hess offers the most compelling argument yet made regarding the actual use of the rifle musket and its influence on Civil War combat. Engagingly written and meticulously researched, his book will be of special interest to Civil War scholars, buffs, re-enactors, and gun enthusiasts alike.</p><p>"Hess hits a bull's-eye with this fresh, provocative book."--Daniel Sutherland, author of <i>Seasons of War: The Ordeal of a Confederate Community, 1861-1865</i><p> </p><p>"A most welcome, meticulous, important, and easy-to-read addition to the literature."--Paddy Griffith, author of <i>Battle Tactics of the Civil War</i></p><p> </p><p>"Should be required reading, not just for students of the U.S. Civil War, but for anyone interested in the history of warfare."--Mark Grimsley, author of <i>And Keep Moving On: The Virginia Campaign, May-June 1864</i></p><p> </p><p>"A landmark study."--William C.

Kennedy Jr., Mother Teresa, and Princess Diana. And who better to pictorially recount the events of this epoch than <i>Life</i> magazine? Divided not by decade, but by nine historical clusters of years (1900-13, 1914-19, 1920-29, 1930-39, 1940-45, 1946-63, 1964-75, 1976-92, 1993-99), this photographic chronicle brings to life the amazing, horrifying, poignant, and thrilling moments that made up a century. Each chapter is introduced with an essay by a distinguished children's writer, including Jane Yolen, Avi, Gary Paulsen, Patrick and Fredrick McKissack, and Lois Lowry, and includes special sections called "Turning Points," which trace a trend or event from the beginning to the end of the century. Concluding each chapter are "Requiems," in which the lives of important people who died during those years are recalled. But it's the more than 380 remarkable photographs from <i>Life</i> magazine's archives that make this volume truly epic. Young readers who spent only a few years in the previous century will look with awe and wonder at the pictures taken during their parents' and grandparents' time, telling about Woodstock, the Holocaust, Babe Ruth, Bill Gates, the discovery of atomic power, and Sigmund Freud. From politics to art to technology to science to social change, this book touches on it all, and will be a tremendous resource for years to come.

Most famous for his story <em>Rashomon</em> and the Kurosawa movie it inspired, Akutagawa&#x2019;s wide range of fiction is beautifully displayed in this newly reissued collection of his stories. With characteristic lyricism and great style, the stories here capture the strange world of Akutagawa, from the slow, gentle death of a haiku master (&#x201c;Withered Fields&#x201d;) to a vicious, marauding gang and their bloody fight with samurai (&#x201c;The Robbers&#x201d;), and the sly tale told from a dog&#x2019;s perspective of his escape from home (&#x201c;The Dog, Shiro&#x201d;). Throughout these stories, Akutagawa captures the often confused spirit of a Japan undergoing great change and confronting modernity at the turn of the last century. But these stories remain timeless classics, and any reader, whether a fan of Akutagawa or someone discovering him for the first time, will find wonderful delight in these unusual stories.

Taken together they constitute a historically rich political philosophy for the present moment....Reading Agamben is insightful and rewarding at every turn; he writes with a clarity uncommon in Continental thought. And the stakes are high for the issues he raises: from Guantanamo to the micro-details in people's Internet identity profiles, the present moment requires that one attend to the watchful warning that is the political philosophy of Agamben....Summing Up: Essential."--S. Young "<i>CHOICE</i> "<br><br>"Taken together, then, these diverse volumes describe 'the two paradigms' of Agamben's political theology, which might be called, after Michel Foucault, 'the sovereign-and-law paradigm' and 'the biopolitical governmentality paradigm', which constitute 'the twin poles' of 'the political machine', by which contemporary human beings are constituted as subjects and made to 'work by themselves' in the 21st Century multinational capitalist system. The <i>Homo Sacer</i> paradigm (the sovereign-and-law paradigm) reaches its penultimate statement in the description of the Nazi concentration camp inmates (the <i>Musselmanner</i>) in <i>Remnants of Auschwitz</i>, which provides the most striking example of how sovereign power reduces its abject subjects to 'bare lives, ' stripped of all civil and human rights and exposed to sovereign violence."--Eric D.

Far from being a part of the state, warriers (the army) are nomads who always come from the outside and keep threatening the authority of the state.</b></p><p>In this daring essay inspired by Nietzsche, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari redefine the relation between the state and its war machine. Far from being a part of the state, warriers (the army) are nomads who always come from the outside and keep threatening the authority of the state. In the same vein, nomadic science keeps infiltrating royal science, undermining its axioms and principles. Nomadology is a speedy, pocket-sized treatise that refuses to be pinned down. Theorizing a dynamic relationship between sedentary power and "schizophrenic lines of flight," this volume is meant to be read in transit, smuggled into urban nightclubs, offices, and subways. Deleuze and Guattari propose a creative and resistant ethics of becoming-imperceptible, strategizing a continuous invention of weapons on the run. An anarchic bricolage of ideas uprooted from anthropology, aesthetics, history, and military strategy, Nomadology carries out Deleuze's desire to "leave philosophy, but to leave it as a philosopher."</p></p><p>Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII, Vincennes/Saint Denis.

She provides hope, wisdom, and perspective for learning the discipline of perseverance.<br><br> Wheatley does not offer the usual feel-good, rah-rah messages. Instead, she focuses on the situations, feelings, and challenges that can, over time, cause us to lose heart or lose our way. Perseverance is a day-by-day decision not to give up. We have to notice the moments when we feel lost or overwhelmed or betrayed or exhausted and note how we respond to them. And we have to notice the rewarding times, when we experience the joy of working together on something hard but worthwhile, when we realize we&#x2019;ve made a small difference. <br><br> In a series of concise and compassionate essays Wheately names a behavior or dynamic&#x2014;such as fearlessness, guilt, joy, jealousy&#x2014;that supports or impedes our efforts to persevere. She puts each in a broader human or timeless perspective, offering ways to either live by or transcend each one. These essays are self-contained&#x2014;you can thumb through the book and find what attracts you in the moment. Perseverance helps you to see yourself and your situation clearly and assume responsibility for changing a situation or our reaction to it if it&#x2019;s one that troubles us. There deliberately are no examples of other people or their experiences. You are the example&#x2014;your personal experiences are the basis for change.<br><br> In addition to Wheatley&#x2019;s graceful essays there are poems and quotations drawn from traditions and cultures around the world and throughout history.

This grounding and inclusiveness support the essential message&#x2014;human being throughout time have persevered. We&#x2019;re just the most recent ones to face these challenges, and we can meet them as those who came before us did.

If we have an idea, or want to resolve an injustice, or stop a tragedy, we step forward to serve. Instead of being overwhelmed and withdrawing, we act.<br><br> No grand actions are required; we just need to begin speaking up about what we care about. We don&#x2019;t need to spend a lot of time planning or getting senior leaders involved; we don&#x2019;t have to wait for official support. We just need to get started&#x2014;for whatever issue or person we care about.<br><br> When we fail, which of course we often will, we don&#x2019;t have to feel discouraged. Instead, we can look into our mistakes and failures for the valuable learnings they contain. And we can be open to opportunities and help that present themselves, even when they&#x2019;re different from what we thought we needed. We can follow the energy of &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; rather than accepting defeat or getting stuck in a plan.<br><br> This is how the world always changes. Everyday people not waiting for someone else to fix things or come to their rescue, but simply stepping forward, working together, figuring out how to make things better.<br><br> Now it&#x2019;s our turn.<br><br> Dwelling in Uncertainty<br><br> The future is no more uncertain than the present.<br><br> Walt Whitman<br> Poet<br><br> Some people despair about the darkening direction of the world today. Others are excited by the possibilities for creativity and new ways of living they see emerging out of the darkness.<br><br> Rather than thinking one perspective is preferable to the other, let&#x2019;s notice that both are somewhat dangerous. Either position, optimism or pessimism, keeps us from fully engaging with the complexity of this time. If we see only troubles, or only opportunities, in both cases we are blinded by our need for certainty, our need to know what&#x2019;s going on, to figure things out so we can be useful.<br><br> Certainty is a very effective way of defending ourselves from the irresolvable nature of life. If we&#x2019;re certain, we don&#x2019;t have to immerse ourselves in the strange puzzling paradoxes that always characterize a time of upheaval:<br><br> -the potential for new beginnings born from the loss of treasured pasts,<br><br> -the grief of dreams dying with the exhilaration of what now might be,<br><br> -the impotence and rage of failed ideals and the power of new aspirations,<br><br> -the horrors inflicted on so many innocents that call us to greater compassion.<br><br> The challenge is to refuse to categorize ourselves. We don&#x2019;t have to take sides or define ourselves as either optimists or pessimists. Much better to dwell in uncertainty, hold the paradoxes, live in the complexities and contradictions without needing them to resolve.<br><br> This is what uncertainty feels like and it&#x2019;s a very healthy place to dwell.<br><br> Finding Our Place<br><br> Humans have a responsibility to their own time,<br> not as if they could seem to stand outside it<br> and donate various spiritual and material benefit<br> sto it from a position of compassionate distance.<br> Humans have a responsibility to find themselves<br> where they are, in their own proper time and place,<br> in the history to which they belong and<br> to which they must inevitably contribute<br> either their response or their evasions,<br> either truth and act,<br> or mere slogan and gesture.<br> Thomas Merton<br> Catholic monk, writer, activist<br><br> History Chooses You<br><br> How did I get so lucky<br> to have my heart awakened<br> to others and their suffering?<br> Pema Ch�dr�n<br> Buddist teacher<br><br> It is strange but familiar to hear people who are now wellknown activists and respected workers for noble causes describe themselves as &#x201c;accidental activists.&#x201d;<br><br> They tell how a compulsion entered them, a clarity that they had to do this work.

Its in-depth and balanced evaluation of more than fifty years of U.S. analysis includes a critique of why it has under-performed at times. It provides insights regarding the enduring obstacles as well as new challenges of analysis in the post-9/11 world, and suggests innovative ideas for improved analytical methods, training, and structured approaches. <br><br>The book's six sections present a coherent plan for improving analysis. Early chapters examine how intelligence analysis has evolved since its origins in the mid-20th century, focusing on traditions, culture, successes, and failures. The middle sections examine how analysis supports the most senior national security and military policymakers and strategists, and how analysts must deal with the perennial challenges of collection, politicization, analytical bias, knowledge building and denial and deception. The final sections of the book propose new ways to address enduring issues in warning analysis, methodology (or "analytical tradecraft") and emerging analytic issues like homeland defense. The book suggests new forms of analytic collaboration in a global intelligence environment, and imperatives for the development of a new profession of intelligence analysis. <br><br><i>Analyzing Intelligence</i> is written for the national security expert who needs to understand the role of intelligence and its strengths and weaknesses. Practicing and future analysts will also find that its attention to the enduring challenges provides useful lessons-learned to guide their own efforts. The innovations section will provoke senior intelligence managers to consider major changes in the way analysis is currently organized and conducted, and the way that analysts are trained and perform.</p><p><b>Roger Z.

What is our deep identity? How do we make a good life? Renowned psychologist Dan P. McAdams suggests that the key to American identity lies in the stories we live by. And the most powerful life story in America today is the story of redemption. On a broad societal scale and in our own private lives, we want first and foremost to transform our suffering into a positive emotional state, to move from pain and peril to redemption. American identity is the redemptive self.<br><br>Based on 10 years of research on the life stories of especially caring and productive American adults, The Redemptive Self explores the psychological and cultural dynamics of the stories Americans tell to make sense of who they are. Among the most eloquent tellers of redemptive stories are those midlife adults who are especially committed to their careers, their families, and making a positive difference in the world. These highly "generative" men and women embrace the negative things that happen to them, for it is by transforming the bad into good that they are able to move forward in life and ultimately leave something positive behind. Unconsciously, they find inspiration and sustenance in the rich store of redemptive tales that American culture offers - from the autobiographies of Massachusetts Puritans, Benjamin Franklin, and escaped African-American slaves to the stories of upward mobility, recovery, fulfillment, and release that come to us today from Hollywood, 12-step programs, self-help experts, religious stories, political speeches, business gurus, and Oprah. <br><br>But can all American lives find redemption? Some people seem unable to make their lives into redemptive tales. Instead, their stories show contaminated plots and vicious cycles. Moreover, might there be a dark side to the redemptive stories Americans love? While these stories can sustain a productive and caring approach to life, they can also suggest a peculiarly American kind of arrogance and self-righteousness. For all their strengths, redemptive stories sometimes fail, and sometimes suggest important failings in the way Americans see themselves and the world. The Redemptive Self encourages us to examine our lives and our stories in full, to apprehend both the good and the bad in the stories we live by. By doing so, we may fashion better stories and better lives for the future.</p><p><br>Chair and Professor, Department of Psychology, and Professor of Human Development and Social Policy,<br>Northwestern University<br>"The Redemptive Self" by Dan McAdams is part cutting-edge psychology and part American history. Drawing on his rich research examining people's life stories, McAdams explores how successful people look back and describe their lives. He finds that the successful or generative life story is<br>one characterized by overcoming adversity, connections with others, and a belief in the future. This common story is, in many ways, the story of America itself. It is the story we like to tell about our past, our leaders, and ultimately ourselves. McAdams constructs a compelling story of his own<br>by drawing on philosophy, history, neuroscience, religion, and psychology. As with his other books, this is a great read." --James W. Pennebaker, Professor of Psychology, University of Texas at Austin<br><br>"In a book that beautifully encompasses imagination and civilization, eminent psychologist Dan McAdams has fashioned a lively and persuasive account of the manner in which we Americans account for our lives. McAdams shows that our personal identity is founded on the stories we tell about our<br>own lives and on our shared membership in the American community, which itself leads to a broad cultural story about enjoying an early advantage in life, being aware of the suffering of others, and transforming our own and others' adversity into an ever more positive future. The Redemptive Self is<br>an elegant masterpiece that dramatically integrates psychology into the realm of human affairs - a memorable book that readers will recommend to their friends." --Bertram J. Cohler, William Rainey Harper Professor, The University of Chicago<br><br>"McAdams has produced a book that shows what is distinctive about Americans' stories--and what is wonderful and also not so wonderful about that distinction. It is a book that can be read for pleasure and insight by psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, and historians, but also by<br>just about anyone who would like to know what it is that distinguishes Americans from others in the rest of the world. I recommend the book highly and with enthusiasm." --Robert J. Sternberg, IBM Professor of Psychology and Education, Department of Psychology, Yale University and Director, Center<br>for the Psychology of Abilities, Competencies, and Expertise (PACE Center), Yale University; Past-President, American Psychological Association<br><br>"Making extensive use of his clinical studies, McAdams examines the stories of highly generative Americans--people with strong commitments to the well being of their country, community and family...a delight, particularly his chapters on race and on nongenerative life stories. Sociologists<br>and psychologists will undoubtedly find this book appealing, but McAdams makes complex topics accessible to the nonspecialist, so the book will likely interest anyone looking to learn more about American culture or McAdam's branch of psychology."--The Publisher's Weekly Review Annex<br><br>"[A] penetrating and fascinating psychological, sociocultural, and historical analysis of...America as it expresses itself in a comprehensive story that the author calls 'the redemptive self.'.... McAdams has authored a very ambitious book that succeeds in great measure."--PsycCRITIQUES<br><br>"...a readable, lively work by a skillful storyteller, and it has won the 2006 William James Award from the American Psychological Association for best general-interest book in psychology. The tale McAdams offers is as rich and nuanced as a fine novel...a tour de force, a model of how<br>cultural criticism should be conducted."--Christian Century<br><br>"Dan P. McAdams' recent book, The Redemptive Self: Stories Americans Live By, is a complex and inspiring examination of American life stories. The book considers some defining American traitsand shows how such beliefs help shape the personal narratives of many who have chosen to work toward<br>the benefit of others..... [A] compelling, well-written work.... It invites personal reflection and a personal response. It speaks with its own narrative voice that is at once approachable and authoritative. [McAdams] has genuine admiration for these individuals and the life stories they tell, and<br>he recounts their stories in a way that engenders this same admiration in the reader." --The Journal of Positive Psychology</p><h2>Building a Healthy Multi-ethnic Church: Mandate, Commitments and Practices of a Diverse Congregation</h2><p>Through personal stories, proven experience and a thorough analysis of the biblical text, <i>Building a Healthy Multi-ethnic Church</i> illustrates both the biblical mandate for the multi-ethnic church as well as the seven core commitments required to bring it about. Mark DeYmaz, pastor of one of the most proven multi-ethnic churches in the country, writes both from his experience and his extensive study of how to plant, grow, and encourage more ethnically diverse churches. He argues that the "homogenous unit principle" will soon become irrelevant and that the most effective way to spread the Gospel in an increasingly diverse world is through strong and vital multi-ethnic churches.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Mark DeYmaz, Author of <i>Building a Healthy Multi-ethnic Church</i></b></p> <p> <b>Q. What is the big idea of your book? </b> </p> <p>A. Local churches should increasingly embrace ethnic and economic diversity for the sake of the Gospel. </p> <p><b>Q. What prompted you to write your book? </b></p> <p>A. An increasingly diverse and cynical society is no longer finding credible the message of God's love for all people as preached from segregated pulpits and pews. For too long segregation along the lines of race and class has been promoted as a strategy for planting, growing and developing local churches. While pragmatic, this strategy is not biblical and unintentionally undermines the very Gospel we preach. </p> <p><b>Q. What is the most challenging concept in your book? </b></p> <p>A. That the multi-ethnic church is not optional, but biblically mandated in the New Testament for the sake of the Gospel: envisioned by Christ (John 17:20-23); described by Luke (Acts 11:19-27); prescribed by Paul (Ephesians). </p> <p><b>Q. How does your book improve leaders' lives? </b></p> <p>A. By challenging and correcting long-held, erroneous, assumptions concerning the segregation of the local church, this book equips and empowers leaders to be more biblical and relevant in the 21st century for the sake of the Gospel. </p> <p><b>Q. What's your favorite sentence/quote from your book? </b></p> <p>A. "Jesus taught us to pray, 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.' So if the kingdom of heaven is not segregated, then why on earth is the local church?" </p> <p><b>Q. If leaders only have time to read one chapter of your book right now, which one would you recommend and why? </b></p> <p>A. Chapter 3: The Pauline Mystery. This chapter will completely rework the reader's understanding of Paul's letter to the Ephesians in an exegetically sound way. </p> <p><b>Q. Step out of your role as author -- if you were recommending your book to a friend, what would you tell them? </b></p> <p>A. This book will help you understand and articulate what it is you've been feeling for a long time: that diverse people ought to be able to walk, work, and worship God together as one in and through the local church. </p><p>"Here's the book many of us have been looking for&#x2014;a book that lays a solid biblical foundation for the multi-ethnic church and includes the building plans! Whether seeking to plant a multi-ethnic church or transform a homogenous congregation, this book will inspire and show the way. "<br> <b>&#x2014;Jonathan Seda, senior pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church, Dover, Delaware</b> </p><p><b>BUILDING A HEALTHY MULTI-ETHNIC CHURCH</b> </p><p>For more than one hundred years, eleven o' clock on Sunday morning has been called the most segregated hour in the land. Despite the integration of public schools, the workplace, and neighborhoods, the local church stubbornly clings to homogeneity. As America grows more and more diverse, the local church will be forced to adapt in order to remain relevant and effective. Good intentions, however, are not enough to inspire systemic change. </p><p><i>Building a Healthy Multi-Ethnic Church</i> explains why the growing fascination with multi-ethnic churches must not be focused on racial reconciliation but on reconciling individuals to Jesus Christ and on reconciling local congregations of faith with the inclusive nature of the New Testament Church. Through personal stories and a thorough analysis of the biblical text, Mark DeYmaz, pastor of one of the most proven multi-ethnic churches in the country, provides the theological mandate for the multi-ethnic church and outlines seven core commitments required to bring it about. Writing from his comprehensive experience in planting, growing and encouraging more ethnically diverse communities of faith, he demonstrates why the most effective way to advance the Gospel in the twenty-first century will be through strong and vital multi-ethnic churches. </p><p>Mark DeYmaz challenges pastors and laypeople alike who believe that the kingdom of heaven is not segregated to create local churches on earth that will not be either. Through such efforts, the Gospel will be newly proclaimed in power and the church restored to a place of prominent influence in an increasingly multi-ethnic, multi-racial nation.</p></p><h2>Chronicles of Avonlea</h2><p>Twelve enchanting stories based on the unforgettable inhabitants of the town of Avonlea.</p><p>On Prince Edward Island, where Anne Shirley grew up in the sea-sprayed town of Avonlea, there was no shortage of wonderful stories.

But no one could blame mischievous Anne for the hilarious battle of the sexes that erupted when a man-hating woman and her cat got quarantined in the same house with a woman-hating bachelor and his dog. From sprawling Penhallow Grange, where a family waits nearly forever for two quarreling lovers to break their stubborn silence, to the tumbledown farm of Old Man Shaw, who awaits the return of his beloved daughter, L. M. Montgomery has written twelve tales of secret hopes and hidden dreams, filled with enchantment and humor.Lucy Maud Montgomery (November 30, 1874 &#x2013; April 24, 1942) published as L.M. Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning in 1908 with Anne of Green Gables. The book was an immediate success. The central character, Anne Shirley, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays.</p><h2>The Energy Non-Crisis</h2><p>"After only one week on the North Slop of Alaska, Senator Chance had said to me, "Almost everything said to me [about the energy crisis] by those briefers from Washington, D.

Enigmatic and sometimes hard to decipher, these inscriptions are a distinctive feature of his work. <i>Reading Cy Twombly</i> poses both literary and art historical questions. How does poetic reference in largely abstract works affect their interpretation?</p><p><i>Reading Cy Twombly</i> is the first book to focus specifically on the artist&#x2019;s use of poetry. Twombly&#x2019;s library formed an extension of his studio and he sometimes painted with a book open in front of him. Drawing on original research in an archive that includes his paint-stained and annotated books, Mary Jacobus&#x2019;s account&#x2015;richly illustrated with more than 125 color and black-and-white images&#x2015;unlocks an important aspect of Twombly&#x2019;s practice.</p><p>Jacobus shows that poetry was an indispensable source of reference throughout Twombly&#x2019;s career; as he said, he "never really separated painting and literature." Among much else, she explores the influence of Ezra Pound and Charles Olson; Twombly&#x2019;s fondness for Greek pastoral poetry and Virgil&#x2019;s <i>Eclogues</i>; the inspiration of the <i>Iliad</i> and Ovid&#x2019;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>; and Twombly&#x2019;s love of Keats and his collaboration with Octavio Paz.</p><p>Twombly&#x2019;s art reveals both his distinctive relationship to poetry and his use of quotation to solve formal problems. A modern painter, he belongs in a critical tradition that goes back, by way of Roland Barthes, to Baudelaire. <i>Reading Cy Twombly</i> opens up fascinating new readings of some of the most important paintings and drawings of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>"This is a beautiful and challenging book. Mary Jacobus takes us into the heart of Cy Twombly's practice, his reading, editing, remembering, and remaking of poetry from Homer and Virgil to Rilke and Paz. In doing so, she illuminates Twombly in new and remarkable ways. I loved it."<b>--Edmund de Waal, artist and author of <i>The Hare with Amber Eyes</i></b></p><p>"In this brilliantly erudite and illuminating study, Mary Jacobus, who is in the front rank of contemporary critics, addresses the languages of paint as well as poetry. As she investigates how Twombly's use of quotation both complements and immensely deepens the power of his visual images, she takes us right to the heart of his doubly articulate genius."<b>--Andrew Motion, UK Poet Laureate, 1999&#x2013;2009</b></p><p>"The scrawled quotations, ruins of mythic poetry, and trailing verbal scribbles in Cy Twombly's work have fired Mary Jacobus to shape an enraptured yet scrupulously precise conversation with the artist's imaginative world. Her deep literary knowledge, fine close readings, subtle psychoanalytical insights, and sheer sensuous delight in paint and color and stroke and rhythm combine here to create a rare and beautiful work of aesthetic philosophy."<b>--Marina Warner, author of <i>Stranger Magic: Charmed States and the Arabian Nights</i></b></p><p>"Many who are not art historians have written about Cy Twombly, but precious few with Mary Jacobus's rigor or fresh perspective. Her examination of Twombly's annotated personal library has turned up revelatory details about his practices of reading, notating, and editing; the sometimes quite literal proximity of book to canvas; and more. Jacobus has done profound work and her book is enormously enriching."<b>--Kate Nesin, author of <i>Cy Twombly's Things</i></b></p><p>"Illuminating and wide-ranging, this is a very significant book. Mary Jacobus's access to Cy Twombly's annotated personal library enables her to speak with unprecedented authority on the literary sources that the artist used."<b>--Stephen Bann, author of <i>Distinguished Images</i></b></p><b>Mary Jacobus</b> is professor emerita of English at the University of Cambridge and Cornell University, and an Honorary Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford. She has written widely on visual art, Romanticism, feminism, and psychoanalysis. Her recent books include <i>The Poetics of Psychoanalysis</i> and <i>Romantic Things</i>. She lives in Ithaca, New York, and Cambridge, UK.</p><h2>Ring of Liberation: Deceptive Discourse in Brazilian Capoeira</h2><p><p>Based on eighteen months of intensive participant-observation, <i>Ring of Liberation</i> offers both an in-depth description of capoeira&#x2014;a complex Afro-Brazilian martial art that combines feats of great strength and athleticism with music and poetry&#x2014;and a pioneering synthetic approach to the analysis of complex cultural performance.<br> <br> Capoeira originated in early slave culture and is practiced widely today by urban Brazilians and others. At once game, sport, mock combat, and ritualized performance, it involves two players who dance and "battle" within a ring of musicians and singers. Stunning physical performances combine with music and poetry in a form as expressive in movement as it is in word.<br> <br> J. Lowell Lewis explores the convergence of form and content in capoeira. The many components and characteristics of this elaborate black art form&#x2014;for example, competing genre frameworks and the necessary fusion of multiple modes of expression&#x2014;demand, Lewis feels, to be given "body" as well as "voice." In response, he uses Peircean semiotics and recent work in discourse and performance theory to map the connections between physical, musical, and linguistic play in capoeira and to reflect on the general relations between semiotic systems and the creation and recording of cultural meaning.<br></p></p><p></p><h2>Devils: The Possessed (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The third of Dostoevsky's five major novels, <em>Devils</em> (1871-2), also known as <em>The Possessed</em>, is at once a powerful political tract and a profound study of atheism, depicting the disarray that follows the appearance of a band of modish radicals in a small provincial town.

Surface anatomy sections provide surface landmarks of important anatomic structures located beneath the skin and often bypassed by practicing clinicians.<br><br>Physiologic and embryologic notes are interspersed with basic anatomical material to point out the functional significance of the material and provide developmental anatomy information that is essential for the understanding of the structure and relationships of organs. Congenital anomalies that may affect the respective organs are listed after these notes.<br><br>Chapter opening outlines highlight the important concepts students should take away from each chapter. End-of-chapter review questions and answers provide valuable assistance in board and course review.<br><br>A free bound-in CD-ROM contains clinical notes, information on congenital anomalies, radiographic anatomy, and clinical problem-solving exercises. The clinical notes emphasize the structures that the physician will encounter when making a diagnosis and treating a patient. They also provide the anatomic knowledge necessary to understand many procedures and techniques and note the anatomic "pitfalls" commonly encountered. The problem-solving sections consist of case histories followed by multiple-choice questions and answers with rationales.</p><p></p><h2>Smell (The Five Senses Series)</h2><p>Do you remember your first realization of any of your five senses?

As a philosopher, historian and political activist, he certainly left behind an enduring and influential body of work, but is this acclaim justified? &#34;Introducing Foucault&#34; places his work in its turbulent philosophical and political context, and critically explores his mission to expose the links between knowledge and power in the human sciences, their discourses and institutions. This book explains how Foucault overturned our assumptions about the experience and perception of madness, sexuality and criminality, and the often brutal social practices of confinement, confession and discipline. It also describes Foucault&#39;s engagement with psychiatry and clinical medicine, his political activism and the transgressive aspects of pleasure and desire that he promoted in his writing.</p><p>Christopher Horrocks is Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Design at Kingston University.

In his long-awaited first book, Paul Boghossian critically examines such views and exposes their fundamental flaws. <br> <br> Boghossian focuses on three different ways of reading the claim that knowledge is socially constructed--one as a thesis about truth and two about justification. And he rejects all three. The intuitive, common-sense view is that there is a way the world is that is independent of human opinion; and that we are capable of arriving at beliefs about how it is that are objectively reasonable, binding on anyone capable of appreciating the relevant evidence regardless of their social or cultural perspective. Difficult as these notions may be, it is a mistake to think that philosophy has uncovered powerful reasons for rejecting them. <br> <br> This short, lucid, witty book shows that philosophy provides rock-solid support for common sense against the relativists. It will prove provocative reading throughout the discipline and beyond.</p><p><br><strong>Paul Boghossian</strong> is Silver Professor of Philosophy at New York University.<br><br>"The book offers a sustained critique of a particular, postmodern-flavored, Rorty-inspired version of relativism/constructivism.

Children and adults alike will enjoy the humor and suspense of these two beloved classics of American literature.</p><p>Biographical Note Irving was born in New York on April 3, 1783. His father had come from the extreme north of Scotland, his mother from the extreme south of England; they had become American citizens by the fact of the Revolution a few years before the birth of their son. The elder Irving, a well-to-do merchant, destined the future author for the law, and he was in fact later called to the bar, though he practiced little. But his legal education was interrupted by an illness which led to a stay of two years in Europe. After he came home in 1806, he joined with his brother and J. K. Paulding in the production of the satirical miscellany, &#x201c;Salmagundi,&#x201d; and in 1809 published his first important work, &#x201c;A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty&#x201d; by &#x201c;Diedrich Knickerbocker.&#x201d; In 1815 Irving went to England on business, but he was unsuccessful in averting the disaster which threatened the commercial house in which he was a partner, and when he turned to writing again it was as a profession rather than as an amusement. His &#x201c;Sketch Book&#x201d; came out in 1819&#x2013;1820, and was followed by &#x201c;Bracebridge Hall&#x201d; in 1822 and &#x201c;Tales of a Traveller&#x201d; in 1824. These works met with gratifying success, and the author was now able to indulge in farther travel. During a prolonged residence at Madrid, he wrote his &#x201c;Life and Voyages of Columbus,&#x201d; and, after a sojourn in the south of Spain, his &#x201c;Conquest of Granada&#x201d; (1829) and &#x201c;The Alhambra&#x201d; (1832). Meantime he was appointed secretary to the American Embassy at London, a post which he held for three years. When he returned to America in 1832 after an absence of seventeen years, he was welcomed with great enthusiasm by his countrymen, who appreciated what he had done for the prestige of American literature in Europe.</p><h2>The Everything Essential Latin Book: All You Need to Learn Latin in No Time</h2><p><p><b>The basics of Latin made fun--and fast!</b></p><br>Learning the basics of Latin can vastly improve your vocabulary and even provide keys to understanding legal, medical, and scientific terminology. <i>The Everything Essential Latin Book</i> is your perfect introduction to this fascinating language.

Treadgold demonstrates that Byzantium&#39;s remarkable cycle of decline and recovery was largely due to the character of individual emperors and inherent weaknesses in the empire&#39;s structure. Each narrative chapter concludes with discussions of Byzantium&#39;s society and culture during six distinctive chronological periods.</p><p><b>Warren Treadgold</b> is Professor of Late Ancient and Byzantine History at St. Louis University. He is the author of many books on Byzantine history and culture.<br>Edward Gibbon regarded the Byzantine (or East Roman or Later Roman) Empire with disdain. It was both a pale imitation of classical Hellenic culture and a degenerate inheritor of Roman Latin political institutions. Although subsequent historians have modified that view, the general perception of a static empire in a state of "perpetual decline" remains. This compact survey of an empire that outlasted the Roman Empire in the West by a millennium may not dispel that notion, but it does pay tribute to the vibrancy, cultural richness, and historical legacy of the first great "Christian" empire. Treadgold necessarily moves quickly, but he convincingly illustrates how the Byzantine (1) transmitted elements of classical culture to disparate groups, including Slavs and Arabs, (2) were instrumental in bringing Christianity to eastern "barbarians," and (3) maintained a degree of stability in the eastern Mediterranean despite constant external threats. This is an excellent general history of a still underappreciated people and of their contributions to the modern world. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

"Of all designed objects letters are probably the most pervasive," as Unger explains at the beginning of his study. "Very familiar yet amazingly diverse in their appearance ... there seems to be no limit to human ingenuity when it comes to varying letterforms."</p><p>Unger approaches the diversity and creativity of the field with a wide-ranging, reflective, critical theory of how we design and make sense of text. The history of typography is surveyed, from cuneiform script to Wim Crouwel's New Alphabet and today's digital developments, and explored in relation to how our eyes and brain process various letter shapes in order to understand text.</p><p>This volume consists of 24 concise chapters, each clearly describing a different aspect of type design (from practical considerations like spacing and rhythm, legibility, size and italics to more ineffable considerations like personality and preference). This theoretical material is illuminated by more than 200 illustrations and practical examples, and an extensive glossary succinctly explains terminology and key ideas.</p><p>Internationally oriented, and taking into consideration the past, present and future of typography, <i>Theory of Type Design</i> will be an indispensible resource for graphic design students, professionals, and those with a general interest in text and printed matter.</p></p><p>[Unger] assesses the diversity and creativity of type and how design makes sense of communicating text.

The six hundred essays he received constitute the single best source on grassroots opinion within the Nazi Party, and they form the empirical foundation for Abel&#x2019;s fascinating yet curiously neglected 1938 book. Although a number of scholars have drawn on these reports, Abel&#x2019;s own treatment has never been surpassed. Of particular value is his presentation of the life histories of a worker, a soldier, an anti-Semite, a middle-class youth, a farmer, and a bank clerk, all of whom explain in their own words why they joined the NSDAP. In the vast literature on National Socialism, no more useful or revealing testimony exists.</p><p>In a new Foreword, Thomas Childers discusses how the past half-century of research and writing on Nazi Germany has upheld Abel&#x2019;s original insights into the broad appeal of the National Socialist movement, thereby reaffirming this work&#x2019;s enduring value for students of the topic.</p></p><p>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s main purpose is to measure, in the light of the author&#x2019;s unique personal data, the relative importance of each of the main factors to which [Hitler&#x2019;s] rise to power has hitherto been ascribed, including Hitler&#x2019;s own leadership, the strategy of the party tacticians, and the favorable circumstances of popular discontent.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Star Wars Miniatures Ultimate Missions: Clone Strike: A Star Wars Miniatures Game Product (Star Wars Miniatures Product)</h2><p>A new handbook that helps players enhance their use of Star Wars Clone Strike&#x2122; Miniatures.<br><br>Second in a series of titles that accompany each Star Wars miniatures expansion, Ultimate Missions: Clone Strike provides extended information and gameplay suggestions for anyone looking to maximize their Star Wars Miniatures experience.

This is not strictly a gardening book (although there is plenty for the gardener to learn in it), but a singular example of a man thinking about what he grows not only how it grows, but its roots in religion, the Bible, history and medicine. The book was written at Chimney Farm, the Maine homestead immortalized in Northern Farm to which he repaired in 1931 with his wife Elizabeth Coatsworth, and where he died in 1968.<br><p><br>Beston described his efforts as "part garden book, part musing study of our relation to nature through the oldest group of plants known to gardeners." But, as Roger Swain observes in his moving introduction, "Herbs and the Earth has an intensity that evokes the herbs themselves, as if, pressed between the pages, their aroma has seeped into the pages." The book is lovingly illustrated with the woodcuts of the great American stone cutter/letter designer/craftsman John Howard Benson.</p></p><p>Beston (1888-1968), a New England naturalist and children's book author whose "chosen home" from 1944 on was a farm in Maine, here writes with an almost Proustian dedication about herbs as human "familiars" of ancient lineage. "The green life of earth is a deeper life than we know," he avows, and walks a leisurely path through species including sage, marjoram, basil and other mainstays. Always exercising a "gardener's musing mind," the author gently but firmly reproaches "the age in which we live" for having "lost the earth," and exchanged this for a "vulgar curse of gigantism," with gardens "fallen into so impersonal a rut." Writing as an appreciator of "subtleties of light" and the revelations of "a simple leaf," Beston pens a hymn in prose, out of print for a dozen years, of unusual depth and eloquence.

Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

Between these epochal events, many of the contours and patterns of English life that would endure for the next millennium were shaped. In this authoritative work, N. J. Higham and M. J. Ryan reexamine Anglo-Saxon England in the light of new research in disciplines as wide ranging as historical genetics, paleobotany, archaeology, literary studies, art history, and numismatics. The result is the definitive introduction to the Anglo-Saxon world, enhanced with a rich array of photographs, maps, genealogies, and other illustrations.&nbsp;The Anglo-Saxon period witnessed the birth of the English people, the establishment of Christianity, and the development of the English language. With an extraordinary cast of characters (Alfred the Great, the Venerable Bede, King Cnut), a long list of artistic and cultural achievements (Beowulf, the Sutton Hoo ship-burial finds, the Bayeux Tapestry), and multiple dramatic events (the Viking invasions, the Battle of Hastings), the Anglo-Saxon era lays legitimate claim to having been one of the most important in Western history.</p><p>Incorporating the latest research in a wide range of disciplines, this definitive history casts new light on the crucial Anglo-Saxon period, from the exit of the Romans to the arrival of William the Conqueror.<b>N.

This text goes beyond simply presenting the latest research. Instead, Schmidt and Wrisberg challenge students not only to grasp but also to apply the fundamental concepts of motor performance and learning via a unique situation-based approach. Movement practitioners using this approach continually ask three basic questions to assist people in motor learning: who (the person learning or performing), where (the context for learning or performing), and what (the task being learned or performed). By working through situation-based exercises and case studies, students learn how to ask appropriate questions, identify solutions, and support their answers with theory or research. </p><p><i>Motor Learning and Performance: A Situation-Based Learning Approach </i>outlines the principles of motor skill learning, develops a conceptual model of human performance, and shows students how to apply the concepts of motor learning and performance to a variety of real-world settings, including teaching, coaching, the design of performer-friendly equipment and work environments, rehabilitation, and everyday motor skill learning. Straightforward explanations of motor skill concepts and accompanying research are reinforced with both ordinary and extraordinary examples of motor skill activities, such as driving a car, playing the banjo, and mountain climbing. By applying the concepts of motor learning to familiar scenarios, the material comes alive for students, leading to better retention of information and greater interest in the application of motor performance and learning in their everyday lives and future careers.</p><p>More than 76 new references, exercises, updated figures and photos, and improved chapter features make the fourth edition of <i>Motor Learning and Performance: A Situation-Based Learning Approach</i> the most user-friendly edition to date. Each chapter is organized to include an outline listing the major topics to be presented, objectives that alert students to key content for mastery, an opening case study that previews the content within the context of a real-life example, research highlight boxes to provide more detailed descriptions of important experiments and concepts, and a running glossary for instant definitions of terms as they are introduced in the text. In addition, the authors make the text even more reader friendly with these elements: </p><p>-It Depends sections require students to identify factors that might influence motor performance and learning situations.</p><p>-From Principles to Practice sections simplify self-testing of key terms by reviewing and providing exercises to apply the information to real-life situations.</p><p>-Special notes with interesting facts and quotes provide supplemental information.</p><p>-A summary with a compilation of important concepts wraps up each chapter.</p><p>-Four additional in-depth case studies are featured in the final chapter.<br>New and convenient online instructor resources are also available to course adopters of this updated text. The ancillary materials include an expanded instructor guide with chapter summary notes and additional situation-based exercises for class discussion, a presentation package of PowerPoint slides for lectures, and a test bank. </p><p><i>Motor Learning and Performance: A Situation-Based Learning Approach, Fourth Edition</i>, continues to combine a conceptual model of human performance with a situation-based learning approach, making comprehension of the principles of motor performance and learning accessible even for readers with little or no knowledge of physiology, psychology, statistical methods, and other basic sciences. In combination with the additional instructor resources and new online student study guide with lab activities, this text will help gradually shift responsibility for learning and applying the information to the student and discourage memorization and regurgitation. There is no better introduction to the fascinating field of motor learning and its many applications in the real world. </p><p><strong>Includes an online study guide!</strong></p> To assist students using the text, <i>Motor Learning and Performance, Fourth Edition</i>, has a companion online student study guide with lab activities that bring the material to life for students. Students will receive free access to the study guide with the purchase of a new text, or it may be purchased as a separate component. The online study guide will help students understand and apply theories and research findings with the following tools:<p></p><p>-Key concepts, key terms, and review questions for each chapter</p><p>-Situation-based exercises to solve, each with two different student responses, an evaluation of each response, and a challenge for students to provide their own responses to the exercise on the worksheet template provided (30 total)</p><p>-Practical laboratory activities, with chapter-related questions, examples, tables, and other relevant learning activities that may be printed out and handed in (20 total) <br></p></p><p><b>Richard A.

David Pleins with Jonathan Homrighausen is an innovative study reference intended for both introductory and advanced students of the Hebrew language to help them understand and remember vocabulary based on logical categories of related words. Since our minds acquire and recall language by making associations between related words it is only natural that we would study language in this way. By organizing Hebrew vocabulary into logical categories, as opposed to frequency, students can quickly begin to familiarize themselves with entire groups of terms and more readily acquaint themselves with the ranges of meaning of particular Hebrew words.</p><p>This reference tool focuses on nouns in the Old Testament, and includes over 175 word grouping categories including pottery, ships, birds, jewelry, seasons, and many more. For each Hebrew term a definition is given and a reference in the Hebrew Bible appears so readers can see the word in context. For many words additional lexical references are indicated where students can look for further study. Words that <em>hapax legomena</em> (words appearing only once in the Hebrew Bible) are marked with an "H" and words that are rare and appear less than 10 times are marked with an "R." Two helpful appendices equip students for further study, these include 1) a Guide for Further Reading where recommendations are given for helpful resources for studying the larger macro categories and 2) Lists of "cluster verses" where several words in a given category appear together, giving students the ability to see how these words function together in context.</p><p><em>Biblical Hebrew Vocabulary by Conceptual Categories</em> is intended to move students beyond rote memorization to a more dynamic grasp of Hebrew vocabulary, ultimately equipping them to read with more fluidity and with a deeper and more intuitive grasp of the biblical text.</p></p><p>J. David Pleins is Professor of Religious Studies at Santa Clara University. He is the author of five books, including&nbsp;<i>The Social Visions of the Hebrew Bible</i>&nbsp;(Westminster John Knox Press),&nbsp;<i>When the Great Abyss Opened: Classic and Contemporary Readings of Noah's Flood</i>&nbsp;(Oxford University Press), and&nbsp;<i>The Evolving God: Charles Darwin on the Naturalness of Religion&nbsp;</i>(Bloomsbury). Pleins teaches courses in biblical ethics, ancient mythology, and the relation between religion and science.&nbsp;Jonathan Homrighausen is an MA student in Biblical Studies at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California."The arrangement of nouns by conceptual categories in this work is innovative and thorough and will facilitate the leaning process while at the same time putting on display the lexical stock and conceptual categories of the Hebrew Bible. Well done!"<br>- Miles Van Pelt, Reformed Theological Seminary<br><br>"I, personally, find it to be quite a useful ready reference, particularly as a way of familiarizing myself with the vocabulary of a conceptual category that I had not yet had occasion to master, but also for its curated bibliography and suggestions for further reading. Overall, this is a brilliantly designed and executed book that addresses a real need in the field of Biblical Hebrew studies and pedagogy."&nbsp;- Kerry Lee, <i>Review of Early Christian and Biblical Studies</i><br><br>"I think that anyone who works with or is interested in the Hebrew Bible will find this volume useful. I am confident that, at the very least, they will find it extremely interesting. What seems most worth highlighting in this review is the fact that, unlike most books of vocabulary lists, this one is likely to benefit the more advanced student or scholar at least as much as, if not indeed much more than, the beginning or intermediate learner."&nbsp;- James F. McGrath, Clarence L. Goodwin Chair in New Testament Language and Literature, Butler University<br><br>"My only complaint about the guide &nbsp;is that I didn't have it at my disposal almost a decade ago when I started learning Hebrew."<br>- Jacob Cerone,&nbsp;Ph.D. candidate,&nbsp;Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit�t<br><br>"The book is both a unique and useful reference for students of the Hebrew Bible."<br>- Phil Long,&nbsp;Professor, of New Testament, Grace Bible College</p><h2>Handbook of Emotion Regulation, First Edition</h2><p><p>This authoritative volume provides a comprehensive road map of the important and rapidly growing field of emotion regulation. Each of the 30 chapters in this handbook reviews the current state of knowledge on the topic at hand, describes salient research methods, and identifies promising directions for future investigation. The contributors&#x2014;who are the foremost experts in the field&#x2014;address vital questions about the neurobiological and cognitive bases of emotion regulation, how we develop and use regulatory strategies across the lifespan, individual differences in emotion regulation, social psychological approaches, and implications for psychopathology, clinical interventions, and health.</p></p><p>James J. Gross, PhD, is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology, a faculty member in the Neurosciences Program, and the Director of the Stanford Psychophysiology Laboratory at Stanford University. He is a leading researcher in the areas of emotion and emotion regulation, and is well known for his innovative theoretical and experimental analyses of emotion regulation processes. He is also an award-winning teacher, a Bass University Fellow in Undergraduate Education, and the Director of the Stanford Psychology One Teaching Program. Dr. Gross earned his BA in philosophy from Yale University and his PhD in clinical psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. He has received early career awards from the American Psychological Association, the Western Psychological Association, and the Society for Psychophysiological Research. Dr. Gross has an extensive program of investigator-initiated research, with grants from both the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. His publications include <i>Psychology</i> (with Henry Gleitman and Daniel Reisberg), and his current research examines emotion regulation processes in healthy and clinical populations using behavioral, autonomic, and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures."This handbook is an invaluable resource for researchers and clinicians interested in emotion, mood, and self-regulation. It brings together leaders in diverse fields to explore the biological and psychosocial underpinnings and clinical implications of emotion regulation. A suitable primary or secondary text for a seminar on emotion regulation, this volume is likely to become a classic in the field."--Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, PhD, Yale University&nbsp;"If human beings are fundamentally in the business of pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain, then this book is about the most fundamental aspect of human life. At long last, the world's experts on emotion regulation have come together to provide a grand tour of the research landscape, and the result is well worth the price of admission. Both students and scientists will find much to be learned in these pages."--Daniel Gilbert, PhD, Harvard University&nbsp;"The <i>Handbook of Emotion Regulation</i> is a handbook in the finest sense--it is comprehensive, scholarly, interesting, and current. Its scope is impressive, moving from theory to clinical application, from cellular to societal levels of analysis, and across the lifespan from childhood to old age. Students will find it accessible, and anyone whose work touches on emotion regulation will find it eminently useful."--Susan Folkman, PhD, Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, University of California, San Francisco&nbsp;"Emotion regulation is a dynamic, burgeoning research topic. Its siren call toward happier, less conflictual, even healthier lives is hard to resist. Gross has brought together a formidable array of experts to illustrate the ferment, diversity, and uncertainty of the field. This handbook is unique in its coverage. Many of the chapters take adult psychology as their starting point, but ample space is devoted to neural processes, cross-species comparison, and developmental changes in emotion regulation, as well as individual differences and their clinical implications. There are also unexpected but welcome chapters examining the impact of cultural and religious traditions. A comprehensive and thoughtful progress report from acknowledged leaders. Students will enjoy the chance to sample the field's variety and excitement."--Paul L. Harris, PhD, Harvard Graduate School of Education&nbsp;"An outstanding contribution to the field of emotion research and theory. The chapter authors include nearly all of those who have been doing recent, cutting-edge empirical and theoretical work in this area, and their contributions are clear, succinct, and comprehensive in scope. This is truly a handbook, addressing topics ranging from the biological bases of emotion regulation to innovative clinical applications, and everything in between. Several authors address relevant topics that are not typically covered in books on emotion (e.g., the neurogenetics of emotion regulation). This volume will serve as an important resource for investigators and theorists in emotion research, for professionals who seek to understand and apply the growing body of knowledge regarding emotion regulation, and for graduate students in neuroscience, neuropsychology, cognitive, developmental, personality, social and clinical psychology and related biological, social, and behavioral sciences. It will be required reading for students in my graduate emotion seminar."--Alfred W. Kaszniak, PhD, Departments of Psychology, Neurology, and Psychiatry, University of Arizona<br><br>"Provides an all-encompassing view of the brain process of emotion regulation, including recommendations and theoretical bases to be used in clinical practice.

(<i>Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology</i> 2009-06-20)<br><br>"Selections are easy to read, comprehensive, and thought provoking....An excellent selection of readings that will inspire researchers in the field....The handbook highlights the work that has been done on emotion regulation and suggests future work that still needs to be done in order to understand the various facets of emotion regulation." (<i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> 2009-06-20)<br><br>"This book presents impressive multidisciplinary research addressing one of the most interesting conundrums of the human condition; i.e., how we can simultaneously control and be controlled by our emotions....This volume is a valuable reference for researchers and clinicians interested in either healthy or unhealthy management of emotions. It also would be an excellent text for graduate seminars devoted to the topic of emotions....Confirmed in each and every chapter of this volume, emotion regulation is extraordinarily complex and should be approached in the mental health field with this perspective. Although the field is far from the point of extracting simple evidence-based therapies for emotion-related disorders, this excellent book places clinicians and researchers on a more realistic path toward that laudable goal." (<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> 2009-06-20)</p><h2>Inside Job: The Looting of America&#39;s Savings and Loans</h2><p>In the tradition of All the president's men , this is a journalistic thriller about the systematic looting of the nations' savings and loans. Far from being precipitated by economic problems, the S&amp;L crisis was a consequence of white-collar criminals, politicians, regulators, the courts, the Justice Department, accountants and lobbyists. Major revelations concern the role of organized crime, the link between the HUD scandal and the S&amp;L crisis, and the use of S&amp;L's for money-laundering. The result of a three-year investigation, the book is less a document than an expose, identifying the players who have left taxpayers with a cleanup bill of $300 billion or more. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Bound to be controversial, this impressive expose by three journalists charges that the S &amp; L industry was taken over by a national network of Mafiosi, corrupt thrift officers, appraisers, auditors and arms- and drug-dealers laundering money, all of whom exploited opportunities provided by the 1982 deregulation. Fortified with unlimited broker deposits, the network plundered hundreds of federally insured thrifts. The authors discount the role of high oil prices, the Sunbelt recession and other factors as catalysts in the S &amp; L disaster. Excepting Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman Erwin Gray, who fought to limit deposit brokerage, Pizzo, Fricker and Muolo accuse the Justice Department, the courts and other federal and state agencies for ignoring or covering up four years of fraud. They also maintain that the guilty have not been punished and little of the loot has been recovered out of official fear of revelation. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Three investigative reporters trace what has happened to the savings-and-loan industry since President Reagan signed into law the Garn-St. Germain bill which deregulated the way thrift institutions can invest money in order to better compete with financial firms that offered more attractive alternatives to savings-and-loan depositors. Some of the results involved shoddy investments that ruined banks and put the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation in deep financial trouble. The authors chronicle some of the more serious cases that involved illegal schemes, organized crime, greedy bank officials, and scandal. Like a good mystery, this is hard to put down, and if the reader has trouble with the jargon, there is a good glossary. A very timely and popular item.<br><i>- Steven J.

He shows how the tragic split between science and religion arose and how, in particular, the modern world-view replaced the medieval world-view in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century.

Venice was then among Europe's richest cities, and its plentiful commissions fostered an exceptionally fertile and innovative climate. In it, the three artists--brilliant, ambitious and fiercely competitive--vied with one another for primacy, employing such new media as oil on canvas, with its unique expressive possibilities, and such new approaches as a personal and identifiable signature style. They also pioneered the use of easel painting, a newly portable format that led to unprecedented fame in their lifetimes. With more than 150 stunning examples by the three masters and their contemporaries, this volume elucidates the technical and aesthetic innovations that helped define the uniquely rich "Venetian style," as well as the social, political and economic context in which it flourished. Essays range from examinations of seminal new techniques to such crucial institutions as state commissions and the patronage system. Most of all, by concentrating on the lives and careers of Venice's three greatest painters, <i>Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese</i> paints a vibrant human portrait--one brimming with savage rivalry, one-upsmanship, humor and passion.</p><p>&#34;This show brought together some magnificent canvases to tell the story of three brilliant men who set painting on a new course while playing some very intricate games.&#34; --Time Magazine, December 8, 2009 (Richard Lacayo)</p><h2>The Last Unicorn: A Search for One of Earth&#39;s Rarest Creatures</h2><p><strong>An award-winning author's quest to find and understand a creature as rare and enigmatic as any on Earth<br><br></strong>In 1992, in a remote mountain range, a team of scientists discovered the remains of an unusual animal with exquisite long horns. It turned out to be a living species new to Western science--a saola, the first large land mammal discovered in fifty years.<br><br>Rare then and rarer now, a live saola had never been glimpsed by a Westerner in the wild when Pulitzer Prize finalist and nature writer William deBuys and conservation biologist William Robichaud set off to search for it in central Laos. Their team endured a punishing trek up and down white-water rivers and through mountainous terrain ribboned with the snare lines of armed poachers who roamed the forest, stripping it of wildlife. <br><br>In the tradition of Bruce Chatwin, Colin Thubron, and Peter Matthiessen, <i>The Last Unicorn </i>chronicles deBuys's journey deep into one of the world's most remote places. It's a story rich with the joys and sorrows of an expedition into undiscovered country, pursuing a species as rare and elusive as the fabled unicorn. As is true with the quest for the unicorn, in the end the expedition becomes a search for something more: the essence of wildness in nature, evidence that the soul of a place can endure, and the transformative power of natural beauty.</p><p>William deBuys is the author of eight books, including <i>River of Traps</i>, a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book of the Year and a Pulitzer Prize nonfiction finalist; <i>Enchantment and Exploitation</i>; <i>The Walk </i>(an excerpt of which won a Pushcart Prize in 2008); and <i>A Great Aridness. </i>An active conservationist, deBuys lives in New Mexico.<strong>One of <em>Christian Science Monitor's </em>10 Best Nonfiction Books of 2015</strong><br><br> <strong>One of <em>Men's Journal's </em>Best Books of 2015</strong><br><br>"<i>The Last Unicorn</i> is a book you simply must read. For one thing Bill deBuys has a real gift for storytelling. And this story, the quest for an animal that was driven to the point of extinction almost as soon as it was "discovered", is a true adventure. Bill's powerful prose leads us deep into the wilderness in an almost unknown part of the world. And it sends out a clarion call bidding us to redouble our efforts to save the last wild places and vanishing animals before it is utterly too late."&#x2015;<b><i>Jane Goodall, Ph.D., DBE, Founder, the Jane Goodall Institute &amp; UN Messenger of Peace</i></b><br><br>"Lyrical... An adventure tale and a meditation, an evocative read that makes clear why wild places matter and how difficult it will be to save them."&#x2015;<b><i>Emily Anthes, <i>New York Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Simultaneously an adventure story, a melancholy parable of the challenges of conservation in an increasingly crowded world, and an engaging introduction to the biota of a unique ecosystem... However intractable the human tendency to pillage our environments, deBuys and Robichaud show the strength of an opposite impulse -- to approach nature with wonder, knowledge, and a deep appreciation of beauty. DeBuys paints the disappearing landscapes of his journey with beautiful and evocative prose."&#x2015;<b><i>Nick Romeo, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></i></b><br><br>"Not only a gorgeous adventure in one of the most remote forests on earth, but also a strategy for hope in an age of mass species extinction.... May this beautifully written book inspire a renewed commitment to the work."&#x2015;<b><i>Dean Kuipers, <em>Orion Magazine</em></i></b><br><br>"The author deftly chronicles both the physical and emotional challenges that come with group travel through an isolated region.... The author's immersive narrative and numerous photos of the unremitting poaching inflicted upon the region's wildlife cause both reader engagement and heartache. A riveting and disturbing account of the clash between the beauty of the wilderness and civilization's unrelenting demands on the natural world."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus </i>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"<i>The Last Unicorn</i> celebrates the marvels of the great forest and its wildlife, and William deBuys enlivens its pages with perceptive accounts of local people and cultures. Inspired and entranced by visions of the saola, DeBuys examines what little is known of its enigmatic life as he searches the landscape for glimpses of what we must hope is an enduring future for the natural treasures surviving in these remote mountains."&#x2015;<b><i>George Schaller, author of <i>Tibet Wild</i>; VP, Panthera; and senior conservationist, Wildlife Conservation Society</i></b><br><br>"This is a great excuse for an adventure--and having taken the excuse, Bill deBuys delivers.

With a wilderness-loving voice that is lyrical but never saccharine, deBuys elicits a sense of mystery and beauty befitting the creature itself."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"The author dives deeper than any ecological treatise, showing readers the beauty of gibbon chatter and "blown-glass waterfalls" and the sheer emotional toil of losing these things.

That it's written by a storyteller as commanding and reflective as William deBuys, well, that's just plain lucky."&#x2015;<b><i>Carson Vaughan, <i>Audubon</i><i></i></i></b></p><h2>The Letters of Gertrude Stein and Thornton Wilder (Henry McBride Series in Modernism and Mo)</h2><p>An annotated collection of the writers&#39; correspondence traces Stein&#39;s contribution to Wilder&#39;s creation of such plays as Our Town and Wilder&#39;s support for Stein&#39;s famous U.S. lecture tour in 1934 and 1935. UP.</p><p>Gertrude Stein, the great lesbian modernist, met Thornton Wilder when he was a young writer in search of a mentor. Stein became that mentor and helped Wilder shape his aesthetic into classic American plays such as <i>Our Town</i> and <i>The Skin of Our Teeth</i>. Begun during Stein's lecture tour of the U.S. in 1934, their friendship lasted until Stein's death 12 years later. These letters record Wilder's attempts to help Stein with publication and Stein's insistence that the writer's work is not teaching or lecturing or seeking fame, but writing. <i>The Letters of Gertrude Stein and Thornton Wilder</i> records not only a friendship, but also the writers' struggles with the position of their writing in American culture.By giving both sides of an ongoing written conversation, this useful collection offers an unusual portrait of a long and important literary friendship. From Stein's thank-you note written in late 1934, the month after Stein and Wilder first met in Chicago, to Wilder's 1946 note of condolence to Alice Toklas following Stein's death, the letters record a warm friendship marked by a sharing of ideas, friends, and (perhaps not least significantly) a belief in Stein's genius. Wilder is the chattier of the two, whether reporting from Vienna that he has visited Freud, who informs him that the Earl of Oxford wrote Shakespeare's works, or from New York, noting that Mabel Luhan's effort to hold a weekly salon has failed. Wilder is forthright in discussing Stein's influence on his work, and in a 1937 letter says that the third act of Our Town ``is based on your ideas, as on great pillars.'' That Stein in turn appreciates Wilder's talent is apparent in her attempt to persuade him to collaborate on her novel Ida: ``a really truly novel is too much for me all alone we must do it together.'' Throughout, the letters are enhanced by thorough annotations that help make them accessible to a wide audience by supplying details on contemporary events and people, explaining allusions, offering speculations, and even editorializing when, the editors say, ``texts appear to ask for it.'' Likewise, the addition of useful supplementary appendices (on Stein's 193435 U.S. lecture tour; and on what occupied Wilder and Stein during WW II, when they exchanged few letters) help round out the scene surrounding the correspondence. Perhaps the most convincing marker of the success of this collection is that, in addition to conveying so much about these correspondents, it prompts one to regret anew the decline of letter writing.

Wall Street appeared to have found the secret for turning everything from risky mortgages to credit card bills into super-safe, triple-A-rated securities. Behind the facade of safety, the financial system had become dangerously fragile. Few had anything to gain from pointing out the risk.</p> <p>Bill Ackman did. In 2002, the hedge fund manager issued a critical research report on MBIA Inc., the owner of a triple-A-rated bond insurer that played a central role in the financial alchemy on Wall Street. "This company will spiral downward," Ackman warned, and he placed a bet against MBIA that would earn his investors billions of dollars if it did.</p> <p>The backlash was swift. Ackman was branded a fraud in the press and investigated by Eliot Spitzer and the SEC. Despite the scrutiny, he spent years telling anyone who would listen why MBIA was a catastrophe waiting to happen. With the onset of the credit crisis, the problems exposed turned out to be bigger than MBIA. An unquestioning acceptance of credit ratings, a blind eye to leverage, a dangerous reliance on financial models, and the abandonment of common sense had become part of a deeply flawed financial system. The collapse humbled nearly every large financial institution and plunged the country into recession.</p> <p>Ackman's story captures an era of delusional confidence, when debt exploded yet risk appeared to vanish. Told by award-winning bond market reporter Christine Richard, <i>Confidence Game</i> is a behind-the-scenes look at how warnings went unheeded as Wall Street careened toward disaster.</p></p><h2>Complementary Therapies in Rehabilitation: Evidence for Efficacy in Therapy, Prevention, and Wellness</h2><p>For over a decade, Dr. Carol Davis opened the minds of health care professionals worldwide to the idea of complementary therapies in rehabilitation.

Davis, DPT, EdD, MS, FAPTA received her undergraduate degree in biology from Lycoming College, an MS in physical therapy from Case Western Reserve University, and a Doctorate in Humanistic Studies (psychology and philosophy) in the School of Education at Boston University and a clinical doctorate in physical therapy from Mass General Institute of Health Professions. As a faculty member at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Dr. Davis has served as Clinical Assistant Professor with Family and Internal Medicine from 1983 to 1985, where she coordinated the Fellowship in Clinical Geriatrics, and from 1987 to now serves as Professor and Assistant Chair of the Department of Physical Therapy. Additionally, she has held the positions of clinical staff and clinical instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital, Assistant Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, and Assistant Professor and Co-Chair ad interim of physical therapy at Sargent College of Boston University. She is an internationally recognized speaker and consultant in teaching and developing curriculum in attitudes and values, ethics, geriatrics, and complementary therapies in rehabilitation. Dr. Davis authored the book, Patient Practitioner Interaction: An Experiential Manual for Developing the Art of Health Care, now in its fourth edition, and with Dr. Christine Williams, she coauthored the text Therapeutic Interaction in Nursing, all published by SLACK Incorporated. Today, Dr. Davis is an active researcher, teacher, and practicing physical therapist in Miami, Florida. She conducts research in complementary therapies, clinical geriatrics, and ethics; teaches entry-level doctoral students and PhD students in physical therapy; and treats patients. She has studied Myofascial Release (Barnes Method) since 1989 and uses it regularly as a complement to her physical therapy treatments. In 2003, she was awarded the Catherine Worthingham Fellow award for a lifetime of outstanding service to the profession by the American Physical Therapy Association."(The book) is an excellent comprehensive resource for the most current research available regarding complementary therapies.

Now, after decades of controversy surrounding their dissemination and interpretation, here is the fullest possible account of what they reveal--how they challenge our understanding of the origins of Christianity, shake the authority of the Hebrew Bible, and provide a new perspective on Judaism at the time of Jesus. <br><br>Although almost everyone has heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls, few people can explain what they say or why they are significant. In The Mystery and Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Hershel Shanks, the distinguished editor of Biblical Archaeology Review, gives a vivid account of their religious and historical context and their dissemination, meaning, and implications.<br><br>Of the eight hundred manuscripts that were eventually found, fewer than a dozen were more or less intact. The rest were mere fragments, many no bigger than a fingernail. The scrolls contain a vast array of bewildering new material: unknown psalms, biblical commentaries, calendrical texts, and apocalyptic manuscripts, many of which seem to foreshadow Christian doctrine. Over two hundred biblical manuscripts were hidden in the Qumran caves, some dramatically different from accounts in the Bible.<br><br>The Dead Sea Scrolls provide unique insight into the turbulent religious world at the time of Jesus, when Jewish society was richly varied and hotly contentious--so much so that some scholars now refer to Judaisms, rather than to a single Judaism. <br><br>This is a clear, definitive account, from beginning to end, for the layperson as well as the scholar, of the mystery and meaning of the scrolls--a model of insight and understanding.</p><p>Since 1947, scholars from all over the world have hotly debated the meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The 200 biblical manuscripts found hidden in the caves of Qumran contain esoteric biblical commentaries, calendrical texts, and apocalyptic manuscripts similar to what can be found in the last pages of the bible. Translation of the scrolls was not an easy task. Much of the language was in ancient Hebrew or Aramaic, written by a sect of Judaism that had broken off from the Hellenistic ways of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The remarkable findings reveal a community of Jews who rejected the archaic teachings of the Temple, set up their own calendar, pondered the meaning of time, and wrote down their views of life after death. <p> Author Hershel Shanks reviews a great number of translations and histories of the period, ranging from ancient historians such as Josephus to contemporary scholars such as Emanuel Tov. He does this to get a better feel for the period of Judaism from the rulership of Herod the Great to the destruction of the First Temple by the Roman Empire, and in order to understand the philosophy that influenced the movement of the Essenes--who are generally recognized as the authors of the scrolls from Qumran. Shanks argues that the key to understanding the scrolls lies within the pages of the period of Judaism that was "remarkably variegated," because it will explain the cultural fragmentation that led to the evolution of thought that manifested itself into the scrolls. This accessible account is highly readable and a great introduction to an area of study that is contentious to this day. Even Shanks recognizes his limitations by humbly concluding, "Gradually, step by step there will be enough for a more convincing synthesis than can be presented today. In the meantime, much work remains to be done." <i>--Jeremy Storey</i></p>Praise for Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls<br><br>"It is diYcult to overstate the strengths and overall usefulness of this volume. . . .

She tracks the flow of a case through the Court. She defines the tricky legal terms. She reminds the reader that we have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court - if the case is within its jurisdiction - as long as we follow the rules. She shows how to use the Internet to keep up with the latest decisions. In addition, the reader will be able to find quickly a list of all justices (and those who were turned down) past and present, the presidents who appointed them, and, uniquely, the party in majority when they were approved. Decisions that changed the course of history are referenced by twenty-two landmark cases.

It presents a thorough treatment of ideas and techniques necessary for a firm understanding of the subject. The text is also recommended for use in discrete probability courses. The material is organized so that the discrete and continuous probability discussions are presented in a separate, but parallel, manner. This organization does not emphasize an overly rigorous or formal view of probabililty and therefore offers some strong pedagogical value. Hence, the discrete discussions can sometimes serve to motivate the more abstract continuous probability discussions. Features: Key ideas are developed in a somewhat leisurely style, providing a variety of interesting applications to probability and showing some nonintuitive ideas. Over 600 exercises provide the opportunity for practicing skills and developing a sound understanding of ideas. Numerous historical comments deal with the development of discrete probability. The text includes many computer programs that illustrate the algorithms or the methods of computation for important problems.</p><p>&#34;The book is a beautiful introduction to probability theory at the beginning level. The book contains a lot of examples and an easy development of theory without any sacrifice of rigor, keeping the abstraction to a minimal level. It is indeed a valuable addition to the study of probability theory.&#34; ---- Zentralblatt MATH</p><h2>Bloody Dawn: The Christiana Riot and Racial Violence in the Antebellum North</h2><p>When four young men, slaves on Edward Gorsuch's Maryland farm, escaped to rural Pennsylvania in 1849, the owner swore he'd bring them back. Two years later, Gorsuch lay dead outside the farmhouse in Christiana where he'd tracked them down, as his federal posse retreated pell-mell before the armed might of local blacks--and the impact of the most notorious act of resistance against the federal Fugitive Slave Law was about to be felt across a divided nation.<br> <em>Bloody Dawn</em> vividly tells this dramatic story of escape, manhunt, riot, and the ensuing trial, detailing its importance in heightening the tensions that led to the Civil War. Thomas Slaughter's engaging narrative captures the full complexity of events and personalities: The four men fled after they were detected stealing grain for resale off the farm; Gorsuch, far from a brutal taskmaster, had pledged to release all his slaves when they reached the age of twenty-eight, but he relentlessly pursued the escapees out of a sense of wounded honor; and the African-American community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania that provided them refuge was already effectively organized for self-defense by a commanding former slave named William Parker. Slaughter paints a rich portrait of the ongoing struggles between local blacks and white kidnapping gangs, the climactic riot as neighbors responded to trumpet calls from the besieged runaway slaves, the escape to Canada of the central figures (aided by Frederick Douglass), and the government's urgent response (including the largest mass indictment for treason in our history)--leading to the trial for his life of a local white bystander accused of leading the rioting blacks. Slaughter not only draws out the great importance given to the riot in both the North and the South, but he uses legal records reaching back over half a century to uncover the thoughts of average people on race, slavery, and violence.<br> <em>The Whiskey Rebellion</em>, Slaughter's previous work of history, received widespread acclaim as "a vivid account" (<em>The New York Times</em>) and "an unusual combination of meticulous scholarship and engaging narrative" (<em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em>). It was a selection of the History Book Club, and won both the National Historical Society Book Prize and the American Revolution Round Table Award.

Writing in an accessible and nontechnical style, Donald P. Green and Ian Shapiro assess rational choice theory where it is reputed to be most successful: the study of collective action, the behavior of political parties and politicians, and such phenomena as voting cycles and Prisoner&#39;s Dilemmas. In their hard-hitting critique, Green and Shapiro demonstrate that the much heralded achievements of rational choice theory are in fact deeply suspect and that fundamental rethinking is needed if rational choice theorists are to contribute to the understanding of politics. In their final chapters, they anticipate and respond to a variety of possible rational choice responses to their arguments, thereby initiating a dialogue that is bound to continue for some time.</p><p>Donald P.

This school of thought--<i>harmonics</i>--envisioned the natural world and the solar system as an interlocking matrix of harmonious numbers, perfectly woven into the creative fabric of life and the surrounding universe. <br><br>Exploring the art and science of harmonics, John Oscar Lieben shows how to create harmonious forms using the ancient tools of number, geometry, and musical tone--an approach that resonates with nature&#x2019;s own ways of creation. He demonstrates many practical applications that result from the study of harmonics, providing analyses of ancient sculpture and architecture, as well as original examples of building floor plans, pottery figures based on planetary proportions, gardens based on harmonic principles, and ceremonial spaces that honor cosmic harmonies and sacred geometric relationships. <br><br>Showing how harmonics can also be applied to the mysteries of time and space, the author demonstrates how the vesica piscis and many other variations of the vesica shape reveal numerical synchronicities and correspondences that connect cosmic time cycles, measures of space, and musical tones. The author applies harmonics and the &#x201c;vesica construction&#x201d; matrix to illustrate many of nature&#x2019;s wonders, including the Earth-Moon relationship, the interactions of the Golden Number and the musical scale, and how the Flower of Life symbol connects the universal field with the pattern of raindrops falling on a pond. <br><br>Offering an approach to sacred geometry that pairs the mystical with the practical, the cosmic with the earthly, the author reveals how the art and science of harmonics should be required study for both the artist and the seeker of eternal truths as well as the scientist who seeks an entrance into the sacred foundations of nature.</p><p>John Oscar Lieben is a geometer who has researched sacred geometry and harmonics for over 25 years. A graduate of New York University, he also studied at Oregon School of Arts and Crafts and Roehampton College in London. A designer and builder of gardens and ceremonial spaces proportioned by sacred geometry, he lives in Bellingham, Washington.<b>Introduction: A Harmony that Structures the Universe</b> <br><br>We are in the midst of a revival of an ancient way of looking at the world as an interlocking system of harmonious numbers. The revelations, which result from this perception, awaken feelings of wonder in those who care about such things. Why should it surprise us that this is the way things are? Marie-Louise von Franz writes in<i> Number and Time</i>: <br><br><i>We have long known that numbers did not always possess the dry-as-dust abstract quality that characterizes them today. Formerly they were not only something &#x201c;godlike&#x201d; but possessed--curiously enough--an all-embracing significance. They did not divide but united two worlds.(1) <br></i><br>When we begin to see in this way it becomes clear that the concept of a meaningless Universe in which evolution proceeds blindly from random event to random event is a delusion. This new way of seeing is really very old. It has been called <i>harmonics</i>, which includes the disciplines of number, geometry, music, and cosmology--the Quadrivium of the ancient mystery schools. Of great importance to the ancients was the discovery of the numerical ratios, which were the basis of musical intervals. While musicians had intuitively employed these ratios since the beginnings of their art, the practitioners of the harmonic arts realized that such intervals could also be obtained through the integral divisions of the musical string. This discovery of a numerical basis for sensory experience was the beginning of exact science. This science of sound as embodied in the musical scales became the foundation of a musical-numerical conception of nature, which included ideas as diverse as astronomical cycles and the nature of the human soul. The art of geometry was part of this exploration since it could visually portray numbers just as music could portray them through sound. In the process of their geometric work it became apparent to the harmonicists that the generated forms had symbolic qualities--that is, they could somehow awaken perceptions about higher realities. For example, the circle seemed to have an affinity with universal cycles and with the infinite; the square with the earthly and the finite. Thus the circle-in-the-square could represent the human being who was seen as an earthly vessel containing a divine essence. This symbolic character of geometry provides a simple way of contemplating complex ideas and processes and as such it became an indispensable foundation in the training of both artists and philosophers in the ancient world. <br><br>Today, as in the past, when space designers working with sacred intention wish to place a firm foundation under their work they must turn to the laws of creation, which include the laws that determine cosmic time cycles and the shapes that arise from natural forces. While these laws can be complex there are simple ways of making use of them, and this is what harmonics offers. The study of harmonics is an entry into a world of cosmic meaning. This ancient art is now rising from the dark sea of the unconscious like a lost continent where once a great, golden civilization flourished. As we unearth the artifacts we wonder why they should appear now. Is there a reason? Isn&#x2019;t everything random and meaningless as so many of us have been taught? The harmonicist knows that this is untrue and the reason the mountains are rising from the dark sea is that--it is time. The wheel has turned, the flower is opening, and the Law must be fulfilled. <br><br>Specifically this book demonstrates ways of creating harmonious forms using geometry and numbers derived from the musical scale. In this approach we are working with tools that are as ancient as time yet perfectly suited to be impeccable instruments for the creation of new forms. The reader will find that the discipline of harmonics naturally weaves together symbolic form (geometric, numerical, and musical) and the practical. The practical applications, the human creations, will be seen to arise naturally from the energy contained within primordial number and geometry. This process resonates with nature&#x2019;s way of creation in which complex forms arise from the simple geometric shapes of atomic structures. <br><br>I have found that there is a creative matrix in which these energies can interact. I have called this the vesica construction. Its central figure is the vesica, the leaf-shaped product of the intersection of two circles. This is a highly charged symbolic figure, which can take infinite forms ranging from a thin sliver, when its intersecting circles are barely penetrating one another, to wider and wider figures resembling fish and eyes and then to broad figures shaped like fruit until it becomes a circle as the intersecting circles join and become congruent. While this figure may seem simplistic, it actually has profound symbolic and generative properties. The process of intersection of the vesica-forming circles exactly corresponds to the intersections of waves perhaps the most universal of dynamic processes in nature. The infinite variety of vesica shapes corresponds to the innumerable height-to-width size ratios of created beings. And the vesica ratios, which we will use, are of great interest in their intimate association with tonal ratios. This will be discussed further in chapter one as well as the establishment of the vesical construction matrix. <br><br>We should note that almost all the constructions demonstrated in the book can be made using <i>classical geometry</i>: geometry created using only compass and straight edge--that is, without the need for measurement. While this simplifies the drawing process there are deeper reasons for this restriction. It requires one to proceed one step at a time, building each new part on a previous part. This is the way of nature: from seed to sprout to leaf to flower. The sequence must be followed. One cannot hurry through and in this there is room for quiet contemplation which invites the unknown, the new, to enter.</p><h2>The Adventure (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>Agamben charts a journey that ranges from poems of chivalry to philosophy, from Yvain to Hegel, from Beatrice to Heidegger.</b></p><p>An ancient legend identifies Demon, Chance, Love, and Necessity as the four gods who preside over the birth of every human being. We must all pay tribute to these deities and should not try to elude or dupe them. To accept them, Giorgio Agamben suggests, is to live one's life as an adventure&#x2015;not in the trivial sense of the term, with lightness and disenchantment, but with the understanding that adventure, as a specific way of being, is the most profound experience in our human existence. In this pithy, poetic, and compelling book<b>,</b> Agamben maps a journey from poems of chivalry to philosophy, from Yvain to Hegel, from Beatrice to Heidegger. The four gods of legend are joined at the end by a goddess, the most elusive and mysterious of all: Elpis, Hope. In Greek mythology, Hope remains in Pandora's box, not because it postpones its fulfillment to an invisible beyond but because somehow it has always been already satisfied. Here, Agamben presents Hope as the ultimate gift of the human adventure on Earth.</p></p><p>Giorgio Agamben is one of the leading figures in Italian philosophy.

We observe family activism moving from generation to generation, and look into the special role of issues that elicit involvement, including abortion rights and social welfare.</p><p>This far-reaching analysis confirms that some individuals have a greater voice in politics than others, and that this inequality not only results from varying inclinations toward activity, but also reflects unequal access to such vital resources as money and education.

Citizens&#39; involvement in family, school, work, voluntary associations, and religion has a significant impact on their participation as voters, campaigners, donors, community activists, and protesters. The authors focus on the central issues of involvement: how people come to be active and the issues they raise when they do. They find fascinating differences along cultural lines, among African-Americans, Latinos, and Anglo-Whites, as well as between the religiously observant and the secular. They observe family activism moving from generation to generation, and they look into the special role of issues that elicit involvement, including abortion rights and social welfare. This far-reaching analysis, based on an original survey of 15,000 individuals, including 2,500 long personal interviews, shows that some individuals have a greater voice in politics than others, and that this inequality results not just from varying inclinations toward activity, but also from unequal access to vital resources such as education. Citizens&#39; voices are especially unequal when participation depends on contributions of money rather than contributions of time. This deeply researched study brilliantly illuminates the many facets of civic consciousness and action and confirms their quintessential role in American democracy.<p>Sidney Verba (1932&#x2013;2019) was Carl H.

Why are religious obligations that conflict with the law accorded special toleration while other obligations of conscience are not? In <i>Why Tolerate Religion?</i>, Brian Leiter shows why our reasons for tolerating religion are not specific to religion but apply to all claims of conscience, and why a government committed to liberty of conscience is not required by the principle of toleration to grant exemptions to laws that promote the general welfare.</p></p><p><p>"Think you understand religious toleration? Think again. Brian Leiter's bracing argument moves deftly from the classics of political philosophy to the riddles of modern case law, demolishing old nostrums and sowing fresh insights with each step. Every reader will learn something from this remarkable book, and, beginning now, every serious scholar of religious toleration will have to contend with Leiter's bold claims."<b>--Christopher L. Eisgruber, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This is a provocative and bracing essay, one that is bound to stimulate much discussion."<b>--Richard Kraut, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"The place of religion in the public arena, and the kind of protection and even respect it should be entitled to from the state, is a topic of significant contemporary interest. Leiter writes about it with wit and good humor. He is even bruising on occasion. But there can be no doubting his capacity as a scholar, his intellectual energy, or his ability to persuade."<b>--Timothy Macklem, King's College London</b></p><p>"Leiter argues that there are no principled, moral reasons for singling out religion as the subject of toleration. He has cut through a dense philosophical and legal literature, focused on a question of great importance, and developed a provocative, sharp, and yet nuanced case. Anyone concerned with this topic will have to read and take seriously the arguments presented in this very well-written and accessible book."<b>--Micah J.

These cars respond well to performance modifications due to their light weight and technology-laden, high-revving engines. And by far, the most sought-after and modified cars are the Hondas and Acuras of the mid-&#39;80s to present. This book covers in detail all the most popular performance swaps for Honda Civic, Accord, and Prelude as well as the Acura Integra. It includes vital information on electrics, fit and drive train compatibility, design considerations, step-by-step instruction, and costs.

Basic methods of Windows message handling are covered, as are advances in mouse and keyboard input handling, and graphical output using the Graphics Device Intefrace (GDI).</p><p><i>Win32 Programming,</i> by Brent E. Rector and John M. Newcomer is a massive, 1,500-page guide to Win32 C programming, something of a lost art these days. Although even the authors admit they use C++ and MFC in their own work, this text, as a one volume document of the powerful Win32 API programming, is truly comprehensive and can replace any number of texts on a programmer's bookshelf. <i>Win32 Programming</i> examines the basics of programming in Windows: from a minimal skeleton program to aspects of the Win32 API, from graphics, menus, user interface components (including the Windows 95 common controls) to more advanced topics like memory management, multithreaded programming, and synchronization objects. (These last topics are useful in that system programmers--or those who write device drivers--may need access to the C API directly.) In addition to presenting reference material (including all the API calls themselves), the authors explain the ideas of how to program in a clearly written style. Though some of the material feels dated (from 16-bit Windows 3.x programming), by and large, the authors do a good job of updating this to Windows 95 and Windows NT. Sections and tips that apply only to one API or operating system are clearly marked. The CD-ROM also includes over 140,000 lines of source code to experiment with, truly a historical treasure trove for the Win32 C programmer. Developers who need to use C calls, or prefer to have printed documentation instead of online help in their compiler, should consider making space on the bookshelf for this enormous title.<p>Windows developers: a thorough understanding of the Windows API will enable you to create applications that are elegant, efficient, and powerful. </p><p>You will find comprehensive information on all aspects of Windows GUI programming, such as: </p><ul> <li>Windows Controls, including the common controls </li><li>GDI, including new features like transformations and geometric pens </li><li>Printing, including a reusable print engine </li><li>Common dialogs, including customization </li><li>Background processing, including synchronization </li> </ul> <p>In addition, the book covers such important advanced topics as creation of Dynamic Link Libraries, storage management, windows subclassing, the Multiple Document Interface (MDI), and threads and their synchronization. </p><p>More than just an introductory book, <i>Win32 Programming</i> is a reference to many of the more obscure and sometimes incomprehensible advanced features of the user interface and graphics subsystems. It is useful not only for C programmers but also for C++/MFC programmers because the API forms the basis for most MFC methods. The book's extensive and comprehensive index means you will never again have to search through pages of examples to find the example of the API function you want to see.

The drama of a budding romancebetween an attorney and recent divorc�e, interspersed with socialbigotry, racial hate crimes, and a trial, is a thin cover for theunderlying sermonizing herein. Narrator Rob Lamont has a deep Southernvoice, but its tedious pitch tends to put the listener tosleep.

Exploring the scientists' world of dark humor, ritualized secrecy, and disciplined emotions, anthropologist Hugh Gusterson uncovers the beliefs and values that animate their work. He discovers that many of the scientists are Christians, deeply convinced of the morality of their work, and a number are liberals who opposed the Vietnam War and the Reagan-Bush agenda. Gusterson also examines the anti-nuclear movement, concluding that the scientists and protesters are alike in surprising ways, with both cultures reflecting the hopes and anxieties of an increasingly threatened middle class.<br><br>In a lively, wide-ranging account, Gusterson analyzes the ethics and politics of laboratory employees, the effects of security regulations on the scientists' private lives, and the role of nuclear tests&#x2015;beyond the obvious scientific one&#x2015;as rituals of initiation and transcendence. He shows how the scientists learn to identify in an almost romantic way with the power of the machines they design&#x2015;machines they do not fear.<br><br>In the 1980s the "world behind the fence" was thrown into crisis by massive anti-nuclear protests at the gates of the lab and by the end of the Cold War. Linking the emergence of the anti-nuclear movement to shifting gender roles and the development of postindustrial capitalism, Gusterson concludes that the scientists and protesters are alike in surprising ways, and that both cultures reflect the hopes and anxieties of an increasingly threatened middle class.</p><p>"An extremely important work. . . .

It's entirely up to the reader.</i><br><br>The journey begins in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> but quickly takes off on a whimsical Austen adventure of the reader's own creation. A series of choices leads the reader into the plots and romances of Austen's other works. Choosing to walk home from Netherfield Hall means falling into <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> and the infatuating spell of Mr. Willoughby. Accepting an invitation to Bath leads to <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and the beguiling Henry Tilney. And just where will <i>Emma</i>'s Mr. Knightley fit in to the quest for a worthy husband? It's all up to the reader.<br><br>A labyrinth of love and lies, scandals and scoundrels, misfortunes and marriages, <i>Lost in Austen</i> will delight and challenge any Austen lover.</p><p>Emma Campbell Webster graduated from Oxford University in 2003, where she specialized in Austen. She currently lives and works as an actress in London. This is Emma&#x2019;s first book.<b>YOUR MISSION</b><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a young Austen heroine must be in want of a husband, and you are no exception. Christened Elizabeth Bennet, you are tolerably beautiful and moderately accomplished, with a sharp wit and quick mind. You are the daughter of misguided but well-meaning parents and live with them and your four sisters&#x2014;Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia&#x2014;in the village of Longbourn, near the town of Meryton. You are of a happy disposition and have hitherto whiled away your years reading, walking and enjoying what limited society Meryton has to offer. A recent event, however, threatens to disturb your tranquility: a man of large fortune has let a nearby manor house. Inconsequential though this change of circumstance appears, it is the first in a long chain of events that will require you to face difficult decisions and impolite dance partners. Equipped with only your wit and natural good sense, your mission is to marry both prudently and for love, eluding undesirable suitors and avoiding family scandals which would almost certainly ruin any hope of a financially advantageous marriage for you or any of your sisters.</p><p><b>HOW TO PLAY</b></p><p>This book is no ordinary book, and should not be read through from beginning to end. It contains many different adventures, and the path you take will depend on the choices you make along the way. The success (or failure!) of your mission will depend on the decisions you make, so think carefully before choosing....</p><p>While your choices will determine your journey, your success will also depend on how well you do in the following five categories: your Accomplishments, Intelligence, Confidence, Connections and Fortune (which could mean either luck or money). On separate pieces of paper, draw up lists for the five different categories. You begin with high scores for your Intelligence and Confidence (200 points each) but with a regrettably low Fortune score (only 50 points), and absolutely no Accomplishments or Connections. In order to increase your chances of marrying well you must try to improve your scores and gain more Connections and Accomplishments. At intervals during your adventure you will be given bonus opportunities to increase your scores by taking tests or answering questions. But take care! While you can gain points, you can also lose them, which could harm your chances of marrying happily and affect the outcome of your adventure.</p><p>If the mere suggestion of scorekeeping gives you palpitations, fear not; you can choose not to keep track of your scores if you so wish. When asked to check them, simply choose whichever score you fancy from one of the two options you are offered.</p><p>You may now begin your adventure. Good luck!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Scientific American Book of the Brain</h2><p>Thirty-two essays deal the brain&#39;s development, reasoning, general intelligence, memory, learning, behavior, brain diseases, and mental disorders</p><p>What's going on in there? If you want to get the latest in neural and behavioral science, there's no better place to turn than <i>The Scientific American Book of the Brain</i>. Thirty-two heavyweight researchers and science writers contribute thoughtful, often eloquent reviews of their own and others' neuroscience research, aiming to help the intelligent reader quickly grasp the current state of knowledge. Reading Elizabeth Loftus on false memories, Kay Redfield Jamison on manic-depressive illness, and Michael Gazzaniga on recent split-brain research is like attending a series of impressively cogent and engaging lectures, without any note-passing undergraduates to distract you. The articles are mostly from 1998, though a few go as far back as 1991; each represents the best, most current writing on its topic. Of particular interest to those who love a good debate are the side-by-side articles on the biological basis of homosexuality and the inclusion of consciousness within the domain of neurobiology by careful writers on opposing sides of each issue--it's a pleasant reminder that not all arguments need end in nationally televised fistfights. You may want to use <i>The Scientific American Book of the Brain</i> as a reference, but you'll find that the writing is so engrossing that minutes or hours will pass by inefficiently while you browse and take in the world of the brain as we know it. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Arguably one of the most compelling and elusive territories of scientific research is the landscape of the human brain. From current research on the genetics of intelligence to new evidence being discovered in the battle against Parkinson's disease, the implications of the study of the human brain, and the equally fascinating human mind, are immense.The Scientific American Book of the Brain presents twenty-six cutting-edge articles on current brain research, by some of the biggest names working in the field: Is it true that most creative geniuses are plagued by a kind of madness? Kay Redfield Jamison reveals the link between creativity and mood disorders; are the brains of men and women equal in their capacity to learn and excel at cognitive tasks? Doreen Kimura puts forward scientific evidence that suggests men and women not only differ physically but also use different approaches to solve intellectual problems; how reliable is the human mind when it comes to memory? Elizabeth F. Loftus exposes how imagination and the power of suggestion can create "memories" of events that did not actually occur; why are certain children plagued by Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and what is the solution for such children? Russell A. Barkley posits that ADHD may arise when key brain circuits don't develop properly, perhaps because of an altered gene or genes.Introduced by Antonio R. Damasio and including chapters on mapping the brain; reasoning and intelligence; memory and learning; behavior; disease of the brain and disorder of the mind; and consciousness, The Scientific American Book of the Brain is a stimulating examination of today's most important and often controversial topics in brain research.

It was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, the temperamental architect who rediscovered the techniques of mathematical perspective. He was the dome's &#x2a2e;ventor,&#x27f7;hose secret methods for building remain a mystery as compelling to architects as Fermat's Last Theorem once was to mathematicians. Yet Brunelleschi didn't direct the construction of the dome alone. He was forced to share the commission with his archrival, the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti, whose &#x23e1;radise Doors&#x27e1;re also masterworks. This is the story of these two men, a tale of artistic genius and individual triumph. </p><p> </p></p><p><p>Paul Robert Walker has written twenty books on subjects ranging from the Italian Renaissance and the American West to folklore, baseball, and miracles. A former teacher and journalist, he lives in Escondido, California, with his wife and two children.</p>Six hundred years ago, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi finished one and two in a contest to design the decorative bronze doors that now grace Florence's beloved Baptistry. Ghiberti, the youngest entrant, was the victor and subsequent recipient of many of the city's most sought-after projects. Wounded by his loss to the upstart Ghiberti, Brunelleschi (who was better educated and from a more respectable family than his rival) set out to reintroduce the glory of Antiquity in their age. Brunelleschi went on to design the dome that has long symbolized Florence's cityscape and succeeded in popularizing the return to the architectural vocabulary of Greece and Rome. Walker, author of various YA books and Every Day's a Miracle, contends (though too often he simply conjectures) that while fighting for architectural and sculptural commissions and fuming at one another, the two artists brought out the best in each other, their peers and subsequent generations. While that may be so, this book is hurt by the author's attempts to construct his imagined narrative without sufficient evidence to do so convincingly. Descriptions lacking originality and force (Brunelleschi's dome is "a vision of curving red tile and white marble perfection set against the pale blue Tuscan sky") and weak argumentation make this a disappointing popularization of the lives and work of two very talented men.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Impaired: A Nurse&#39;s Story of Addiction and Recovery</h2><p>On June 28, 1996, Patricia Holloran's life changed forever when Drug Control confronted her for the theft of narcotics from the hospital where she worked. So begins a journey that will change everything about what she knows about herself and the world of addiction. <p>As a nurse in a labor and delivery unit, Holloran was working full time on the night shift and taking care of her three children, her husband, and her severely disabled father. She started to take Stadol, a narcotic ten times stronger than morphine, to help her sleep. She kept taking it because she could not stop. </p><p>Putting a face on addiction and recovery, and the taboo subject of healthcare worker abuse, <i>Impaired</i> takes readers on Holloran's journey to fight for her sobriety, her nursing license, her marriage, and ultimately, to help other nurses and healthcare workers who suffer from addiction.</p></p><p><b>Patricia Holloran, RN</b>, has been a nurse for more than 30 years. She has served as Chairperson of the Recovering Nurse Community of Connecticut, a committee that oversees the anonymous support group, Nurses for Nurses. She speaks regularly about issues of addiction as a guest lecturer for various levels of nursing education and at conventions. She lives with her husband in Connecticut, and has three grown sons.Though Holloran's memoir may read familiar for anyone with an addiction memoir under his belt, what makes her story unique is her insider's view of the health care and recovery fields. A nurse suffering an addiction to Stadol, a little known painkiller, Holloran kept her addiction a secret from everyone-even from her husband-while stealing from the hospital where she worked, moving on to abuse prescription nasal spray, and later to shooting illicit drugs. Confronted by the Health Department's Drug Control agents, Holloran buckled, joined rehab and a support group called Nurses for Nurses, and began the arduous process of fighting to hold her life and career together. A poignant rendition of the addiction-recovery narrative, Holloran's most important work exposes the failure of the U.S. health care system to protect even its own. Though little here will surprise (as addiction behavior goes, hers was fairly tame), readers will respond to Holloran's honest, personal, unexpectedly complex tour of the U.S. health and rehab industries. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Because the degree of developmental delay varies greatly from child to child, a thorough motor evaluation is an important step before establishing a specific therapy plan. </p><p> This new guide, written by an experienced physical therapist, provides parents with a complete understanding of how the physical characteristics of cerebral palsy and similar conditions--muscle tightness and weakness, increased or decreased flexibility, abnormal reflexes, impaired sensory perception--affect a child's ability to sit, crawl, stand, and walk.</p><p> With that foundation established, the book offers dozens of practical, easy-to-follow exercises that address specific areas of motor delay and development, including:<br> Head control;<br> Muscle tone;<br> Proper positioning;<br> Involuntary movements;<br> Stretching and flexibility;<br> Balance and coordination;<br> Strength training.</p><p> The exercises are illustrated with photos, and many present one or two variations, which take into account a child s preferences and skill level. Additionally, every chapter includes profiles of children in therapy, and a set of frequently asked questions on the chapter topic. </p><p> With <b>Teaching Motor Skills</b>, parents will be more knowledgeable about their child's unique set of strengths and weaknesses, and better able to contribute to his motor development. As the book emphasizes, learning new skills depends upon many factors, including the reinforcement of at-home therapy and good cooperation and communication between a child s physical therapist and parents.</p></p><p>Learn the best practices for improving motor development in children with cerebral palsySieglinde Martin, M.S., P.T., is a physical therapist with more than thirty years of clinical experience working with children with cerebral palsy and their families.

It went on to win the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize for Fiction and quickly became an international bestseller. Twenty years later, the novel has established itself as a modern classic. To commemorate the anniversary of its first English-language publication, HarperCollins is proud to offer a special hardcover edition.</p><p>A young woman in love with a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing; one of his mistresses and her humbly faithful lover -- these are the two couples whose story is told in this masterful novel.</p><p>Controlled by day, Tereza's jealousy awakens by night, transformed into ineffably sad death-dreams, while Tomas, a successful surgeon, alternates loving devotion to the dependent Tereza with the ardent pursuit of other women. Sabina, an independent, free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayals -- of parents, husband, country, love itself -- whereas her lover, the intellectual Franz, loses all because of his earnest goodness and fidelity.</p><p>In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel, says the novelist, "the unbearable lightness of being" -- not only as the consequence of our private acts but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine.</p><p>This magnificent novel encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, and embraces, it seems, all aspects of human existence. It juxtaposes geographically distant places (Prague, Geneva, Paris, Thailand, the United States, a forlorn Bohemian village); brilliant and playful reflections (on "eternal return," on kitsch, on man and animals -- Tomas and Tereza have a beloved doe named Karenin); and a variety of styles (from the farcical to the elegiac) to take its place as perhaps the major achievement of one of the world's truly great writers.</p></p><p><p>A young woman is in love with a successful surgeon, a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing.

She is editor of the current 6th edition of the <em>Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</em>.<br>This new edition of the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i> has been substantially updated and revised since it was first published, in 2000. Although the first edition was a hefty 1,200 pages, this new edition is 805 pages. The reduction in size is comes from trimming the number of biographical and geographical entries, such as <i>Ferdinand of Aragon</i> and <i>Zurich.</i> The first edition also had numerous single-word entries, such as <i>fault</i>, <i>faience</i>, and <i>zucchetto,</i> that could be found in a regular dictionary. These types of entries have been taken out and replaced by many more contemporary phrases. Gone, too, are the boxed entries for special categories. The second edition has also changed the formatting of its entries, listing all phrases using the same word under that word, with numerous cross-references to related phrases. The first edition listed all phrases separately. <p>What makes this new edition especially valuable are the many new entries from politics, popular culture, science, and contemporary language, such as <i>axis of evil, chaos theory</i>, <i>elephant in the room</i>, <i>glass ceiling</i>, <i>ground zero</i>, <i>Sunni Triangle</i>,and many more. All entries explain what the phrase means and where it was first used. The second edition has also expanded the number of phrases from classic literature, history, mythology, religion, and figurative language using Oxford's extensive word and language online resources. </p><p>The major competitor is Brewer's <i>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i>, the seventeenth edition of which was published in Great Britain last year. <i>Brewer's</i> was first published in 1870 and has always been very classically oriented, with numerous entries for the names of mythological characters, persons from the Bible, and historical personages, which were deleted from the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i>. Without seeing the new <i>Brewer's,</i> it's probably safe to say that, although the two dictionaries have considerable overlap, each has a wide variety of entries that are unique. </p><p><i>The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i> is a highly useful tool to help understand what phrases mean and where they come from and should definitely be added to all reference collections. It is recommended that libraries keep the first edition since many entries in the first edition have been deleted from the second. Libraries should also have <i>Brewer's</i> since its focus is more classical and it includes phrases that are not found in <i>Oxford.</i><i>Merle Jacob</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Coming at a time of public concern and controversy regarding the future of the forest, this book provides a fresh examination of the natural dynamics that have produced the remarkably lush growth characterizing roughly two thousand miles of coast from Coos Bay, Oregon, to the gulf of Alaska&#x2015;a stretch of greater north-south ecological sameness than exists anywhere else on earth. The rain forest valleys of Washington's Olympic Peninsula stand out as the showpiece of this region. Because the forest's productivity and sheer biomass per square mile are among the world's greatest, it is recognized as a National Park, a World Biosphere Reserve, and a World Heritage Site.<br><br>Pointing out that ecology and economics share the same root (oikos, meaning "home"), this book evokes the forest's beauty and intricacy while summarizing scientific understanding of components and interactions. We learn that moldering logs produce their own moisture as a by-product of decay, and are virtual reservoirs as well as storehouses of nutrients&#x2015;qualities that contribute to their role as the rain forest's famed nurse logs, which act as seedbeds for oncoming generations of spruce and hemlock. We also learn that fallen trees affect stream flow and crucially influence the well-being of aquatic organisms (including fish) and that, washed downriver, they modify both beach character and life in the ocean near river mouths.<br><br>The unique ecological web of this ancient forest&#x2015;which has existed for at least five thousand years&#x2015;includes the peculiar above-ground rooting of maple trees, which actually feed from the mossy "upholstery" covering their trunks and branches; the role of elk as "landscape gardners" preventing the understory from becoming a thicket; and a newly discovered life community within the gravel zone of river bottoms and out under the forest floor.<br><br>"Many of the spruce and hemlock trees we walk among today were alive when men like Sir Francis Bacon and Johannes Kepler first recognized the value of objective data over mystical portents," write authors Ruth Kirk and Jerry Franklin. "They have been pushing their roots through the soil and wafting seeds into the air throughout the entire existence of science."<br><br>This book will be welcomed by resident Northwesterners and travelers as well as by all who are interested in nature. Its prose is both broadly readable and scientifically sound. More than 100 color photographs catch the variety and grandeur of this magnificent forest.</p><p>&#39;The Olympic Rain Forest&#39; evokes the forest&#39;s beauty and intricacy while summarizing scientific understanding of its components and interactions, and will be welcomed by resident Northwesterners and travelers as well as by all who are interested in nature.

He is the 2008-2009 president of the Society for the Study of Social Problems and had previously served as a member of the SSSP Board of Directors, as chair of its Law and Society Division and Editorial and Publications Committee, and as an advisory editor of its journal,<i>Social Problems.</i> He has served on the student paper award committees of the Crime, Law, and Deviance and Sociology of Law sections of the American Sociological Association. Professor Barkan has written many journal articles dealing with topics such as racial prejudice and death penalty attitudes, views on police brutality, political trials, and feminist activism. These articles have appeared in the <i>American Sociological Review, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Journal of Crime and Justice, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, Justice Quarterly, Social Forces, Social Problems, Sociological Forum, Sociological Inquiry,</i> and other journals. For Prentice Hall, he is the author of Criminology: A Sociological Understanding, 4/e and of Law and Society: An Introduction (both coming out in early 2008).<br> <br>Professor Barkan welcomes comments from students and faculty about these books.

(PMS-38)</h2><p><p>This book offers a systematic and comprehensive presentation of the concepts of a spin manifold, spinor fields, Dirac operators, and A-genera, which, over the last two decades, have come to play a significant role in many areas of modern mathematics. Since the deeper applications of these ideas require various general forms of the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem, the theorems and their proofs, together with all prerequisite material, are examined here in detail. The exposition is richly embroidered with examples and applications to a wide spectrum of problems in differential geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. The authors consistently use Clifford algebras and their representations in this exposition. Clifford multiplication and Dirac operator identities are even used in place of the standard tensor calculus. This unique approach unifies all the standard elliptic operators in geometry and brings fresh insights into curvature calculations. The fundamental relationships of Clifford modules to such topics as the theory of Lie groups, K-theory, KR-theory, and Bott Periodicity also receive careful consideration. A special feature of this book is the development of the theory of Cl-linear elliptic operators and the associated index theorem, which connects certain subtle spin-corbordism invariants to classical questions in geometry and has led to some of the most profound relations known between the curvature and topology of manifolds.</p></p><p></p><h2>Respiratory Care Exam Review: Review for the Entry Level and Advanced Exams</h2><p><p><i>Respiratory Care Exam Review: Review for the Entry Level and Advanced Exams, 3rd Edition</i>, readies students with review materials for both the CRT and RRT exams!

IP.</p><p>This collaboration by a quartet of Oregon-based cooks does indeed contain some gourmet recipes. The assumption, however, is that the reader knows absolutely nothing, and needs to be led through each step of (for example) the chicken-roasting process. The authors also know when to act as a cheering section: "If you can fall out of bed, you've got the brains to do this." <b>The Basic Gourmet</b> will convince you that you do.Four experienced cooking instructors with an irresistible love of their subject go far toward teaching beginners in the kitchen to learn to cook and to learn to love cooking. Starting off with a brief, lucid run-through of essential equipment, ingredients, terms and techniques (including how to read a recipe), they ease into recipes?for "basic American" dishes?that are gracefully written, succinct and easy-to-follow. Covered are classics, e.g., roast leg of lamb, poached salmon and strawberry shortcake; modern standbys like lasagna, burritos and stir-frys; such comfort food as mashed potatoes and "Golden Raisin Bread Pudding." Throughout, "Cook's Notes" offer explanations and variations, while concise essays ("Buying Fresh Fish and Shellfish," "Tips on Making Green Salads") amplify further with advice on cleaning and storage, etc. Appealing photos, an engaging format and the right amount (never too much) of information tempt new cooks to become good cooks who will likely enjoy both the product and process of their efforts. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Frazzled Female: Finding Peace in the Midst of Daily Life (Bible Study Book)</h2><p>The Frazzled Female Bible Study by Cindi Wood is a resource designed especially for women.

His letters propel his readers into two ancient worlds, one Jewish, one pagan. The first was incandescent with apocalyptic hopes, expecting God through his messiah to fulfill his ancient promises of redemption to Israel. The second teemed with ancient actors, not only human but also divine: angry superhuman forces, jealous demons, and hostile cosmic gods. Both worlds are Paul&#x2019;s, and his convictions about the first shaped his actions in the second.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only by situating Paul within this charged social context of gods and humans, pagans and Jews, cities, synagogues, and competing Christ-following assemblies can we begin to understand his mission and message. This original and provocative book offers a dramatically new perspective on one of history&#x2019;s seminal figures.</p><p><b>Paula Fredriksen</b>, Aurelio Professor of Scripture emerita at Boston University, is a member of the Humanities Faculty of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem.&#x201c;Wide-ranging, deeply learned, but accessible . . .

For millennia, religions have concocted numerous manifestations of heaven and the afterlife, the place where souls go after the death of the physical body. Religious leaders have toiled to make sense of this place that a surprising 74% of Americans believe exists, but from which no one has ever returned to report what it is really like. </p><p><i>Heavens on Earth</i> concludes with an uplifting paean to purpose and progress and what we can do in the here-and-now, whether or not there is a hereafter.</p></p><p><b>Michael Shermer</b> is the publisher of <i>Skeptic</i> magazine, a monthly columnist for <i>Scientific American</i>, and a Presidential Fellow at Chapman University.

Most Americans, and even many atheists, believe that the answer is &#x2018;yes.&#x2019; If there is no heaven, how can we find purpose in life?

Krueger have already made national news with their pathbreaking research on the minimum wage. Here they present a powerful new challenge to the conventional view that higher minimum wages reduce jobs for low-wage workers. In a work that has important implications for public policy as well as for the direction of economic research, the authors put standard economic theory to the test, using data from a series of recent episodes, including the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990-91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In each case they present a battery of evidence showing that increases in the minimum wage lead to increases in pay, but no loss in jobs.</p><br><p> A distinctive feature of Card and Krueger's research is the use of empirical methods borrowed from the natural sciences, including comparisons between the "treatment" and "control" groups formed when the minimum wage rises for some workers but not for others. In addition, the authors critically reexamine the previous literature on the minimum wage and find that it, too, lacks support for the claim that a higher minimum wage cuts jobs. Finally, the effects of the minimum wage on family earnings, poverty outcomes, and the stock market valuation of low-wage employers are documented. Overall, this book calls into question the standard model of the labor market that has dominated economists' thinking on the minimum wage. In addition, it will shift the terms of the debate on the minimum wage in Washington and in state legislatures throughout the country.</p></p><p><p>"Most economists believe that minimum wages invariably reduce employment, but are they right? In this compelling analysis of the U.S. minimum wage, Card and Kreuger show that recent increases in the minimum wage had no adverse effect on employment. This pathbreaking book suggests that economists know less about what the invisible hand is up to than they let on."--<b>Richard Freeman, London School of Economics and Harvard University</b></p> <p>"<i>Myth and Measurement</i>is an extraordinarily important book.

David Moffitt awoke around eight o&#x2019;clock and put on civilian clothes. He had a cup of coffee, then went out to the garden on the south side of his brick house, on Liberty Island, and started pulling weeds. A trained floriculturist who&#x2019;d worked on Lady Bird Johnson&#x2019;s beautification efforts in Washington, DC, he had a spectacular vegetable garden. As the superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, he also had a spectacular backyard. As usual for a day off, he planned to do a little bit of gardening before going to Manhattan with his wife and three kids, to go shopping in the city or bike riding in Central Park. It was a clear day, about 50 degrees, with a steady light wind out of the southwest. Moffitt was on his knees, pruning roses, a couple of hours later, when Mike Tennent, his chief ranger, ran up and told him that two guys were climbing the outside of the statue. That was a first. Moffitt looked up, focused his hazel eyes, and confirmed the claim. So much for his day off.<br> <br>It was about 150 yards from Moffitt&#x2019;s house to the statue, and on the walk there, he could hear visitors yelling from the base of the pedestal up at the climbers. &#x201c;Assholes!&#x201d; they yelled. &#x201c;Faggots!&#x201d; Their visits were being interrupted, and they objected, because they knew the situation was unlikely to end in their favor. Moffitt was already as mad as the visitors, but not for the same reason. He thought the climbers were desecrating the statue, and probably damaging it. Moffitt, who was forty-one, with thick dark brown hair and a Houston accent, had gotten the job&#x2014;considered a hardship assignment on account of the isolation&#x2014;because of his good track record with maintenance. The island, and the statue, had fallen into disrepair; the National Park Service recognized that its maintenance programs were wholly deficient. Moffitt was the first full-time caretaker in a dozen years.<br> <br>Halfway to the statue, Moffitt stopped, and watched the climbers unfurl a banner. Liberty Was Framed, it said in bold red letters, above Free Geronimo Pratt. Until then, he&#x2019;d figured the climbers were just pranksters. Now, though he didn&#x2019;t know who Geronimo Pratt was, he knew the duo were protesters. And he knew how to resolve the situation. The NYPD had a team skilled at removing people from high places&#x2014;he&#x2019;d seen footage on TV&#x2014;and he would call them. So he turned around, walked to his office, and ordered the island evacuated. Inside the statue, an announcement blared over its PA system requesting that visitors proceed to the dock area due to an operational problem. In his office, Moffitt then called the National Park Service Regional Director&#x2019;s Office in Boston. He&#x2019;d done this a few times before, and was destined to do it many more times again.<br> <br>On his watch, Puerto Rican nationals had occupied the statue for most of a day, and a handful of Iranian students had chained themselves to the statue, protesting America&#x2019;s treatment of the Shah. On his watch, he dealt with about ten bomb threats a year. Before his time, the statue had been the site for college kids protesting President Richard Nixon, veterans protesting Vietnam, the American Revolutionary Students Brigade protesting the Iranian government, and the mayor of New York protesting the treatment of Soviet Jews. As Moffitt well recognized, the statue was the ideal place to protest any perceived wrong. So Moffitt called the NYPD, rather than the US Park Police&#x2014;and this decision had ramifications for the climbers, and more importantly, the statue.<br> <br>When the NYPD&#x2019;s Emergency Service Unit arrived, its agents were cheered by the departing visitors. They quickly assessed the situation. A &#x201c;removal,&#x201d; they determined, would be too dangerous. They figured nets were needed. And helicopters. Given all of this, Moffitt figured that the situation might take a while to conclude and told his wife to go to Manhattan without him. Then he learned from the NYPD that Geronimo Pratt was a Black Panther convicted in the murder of a Santa Monica teacher, a crime for which he&#x2019;d been imprisoned for a decade, and he remained angry. There was nothing admirable about desecrating the statue, no matter the cause. &#x201c;I took the job of protecting this symbol of America very seriously,&#x201d; Moffitt recalled.<br> <br>Moffitt spent the day in his office, watching the climbers through a pair of government-issued binoculars. That afternoon, he took a call from a reporter at the New York Daily News. In the middle of the interview, he heard a banging sound coming from the statue. &#x201c;God damn them!&#x201d; someone below the statue yelled at the same time. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re busting my statue!&#x201d; A ranger came in the office and said one of the climbers was driving pitons into the copper skin. Moffitt doesn&#x2019;t recall how many bangs he heard, but he remembers being frantic. Now he was sure they were damaging his statue. He yelled at the reporter, then hung up.<br> <br>Up on the statue, Ed Drummond, a thirty-four-year-old English poet from San Francisco with an arrest record for climbing buildings and hanging banners, was struggling. After traversing around the left foot, then up and left, the climbing became more difficult than he had expected, or had been prepared for. It had taken him two hours to get to the crook of Lady Liberty&#x2019;s right knee, and now he was stuck on a small ledge, looking up at a short chimney in the folds of the robe on her back. The surface of the copper skin, in particular, was causing problems, rendering his two eight-inch suction cups useless. The skin was covered in millions of little bumps, almost like acne, the result of the French craftsmen who pounded the copper into shape a century before. Consequently, his suction cups stuck only for about ten seconds, even if he pushed with all of his might. &#x201c;I realized that they were not going to work,&#x201d; he recalled, describing the fatigue he began to feel in his arms. He slipped, slithered down a few feet, and barely caught himself with his other suction cup. He was aware of the consequences of falling. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d just go hurtling out into the air,&#x201d; he recalled, &#x201c;and end up two hundred feet down on the esplanade.&#x201d; It was also almost certain that if that happened, he would pull his climbing partner, Stephen Rutherford&#x2014;a thirty-one-year-old teacher-in-training from Berkeley, California&#x2014;off too.<br> <br>As he climbed, he could see that between the plates of copper there was often a small gap. The plates had begun to lift for some reason, though the edge formed was not big enough to use for climbing. He also noticed many little holes in the statue, which he had not seen from the ground. Rumor had it, among Statue of Liberty buffs, that they were bullet holes. As the climbing grew more desperate, with his back on one wall of the chimney and both of his feet on the other, he tried placing a tiny S-hook, which he&#x2019;d bought last minute, in one of the holes, for support. Using a sling, he weighted it, and under less than his full weight, it bent alarmingly.<br> <br>Drummond had planned to climb up the statue&#x2019;s back, and onto her left shoulder, then stay in a little cave under the lock of hair over her left ear. Sheltered from wind and rain, anchored to that lock of hair, he planned to keep a weeklong vigil. (He brought a sleeping bag, and a supply of cheese, dates, apples, canned salmon, and water bottles.) He planned to drape his banner across the statue&#x2019;s chest, like a bra. But he never made it past the chimney. Instead, he decided to spend the night on the ledge, and descend in the morning. He told as much to the NYPD, who relayed the information to Moffitt. That night, Moffitt didn&#x2019;t get much sleep. From his bed, through his window, he watched Drummond and Rutherford. His children complained about all of the hubbub and helicopters flying around.<br> <br>The next morning&#x2014;Mother&#x2019;s Day&#x2014;Drummond and Rutherford surrendered, more or less twenty-four hours after they&#x2019;d started. By the time they&#x2019;d rappelled to the statue&#x2019;s feet, the press had shown up on the mezzanine. A reporter yelled up, &#x201c;Did you use any pitons?&#x201d; Immediately, Drummond yelled down, &#x201c;No, we haven&#x2019;t damaged the statue!&#x201d; Then, below the small overhang formed by the little toe of the statue&#x2019;s left foot, he yelled, &#x201c;This is how we climbed the statue!&#x201d; and pressed one of the suction cups against the metal. He and Rutherford hung from it. As they descended into the scrum of police waiting with handcuffs, Drummond insisted, again, that he hadn&#x2019;t damaged the statue. Moffitt, though, later told the Associated Press reporter that the climbers were &#x201c;driving small spikes&#x201d; into the statue. As he was talking to reporters, someone handed Moffitt a note from the US Attorney&#x2019;s Office. It said, &#x201c;Do not offer them amnesty.&#x201d; Moffitt wasn&#x2019;t about to. He was furious.<br> <br>After a night in jail, Drummond and Rutherford were charged with criminal trespassing and damaging government property, to the tune of $80,000. By then, Moffitt had studied the statue through his binoculars, and discovered the same holes that Drummond had. He&#x2019;d also sent one of his maintenance guys up the statue to inspect the damage from the inside. He discovered that the holes were everywhere, and weren&#x2019;t the result of pounding pitons, or spikes of any kind, into the copper. They were places where the rivets, which held the statue&#x2019;s copper skin to her iron frame, had popped out. The holes in the statue hadn&#x2019;t been created by Drummond at all. They&#x2019;d been created by corrosion.<br> <br>So Ed Drummond was right. Liberty was framed, and her frame was rusting.<br> <br><br> <br>What had been interpreted as an act of vandalism turned out to be a much bigger headache for Moffitt. Sure, there was graffiti on the inside of the statue, but nobody had ever damaged the outside. At least Moffitt was pretty sure. Perplexed, he dug through a file cabinet, in search of reports on the statue&#x2019;s condition. He found none. So he had a short section of scaffolding put up to inspect the damage on the statue. Scuff marks, and small spots where Drummond&#x2019;s rope had worn away the green patina, were discovered. He also called the National Park Service&#x2019;s design/construction firm in Denver, and asked their engineers to examine the statue and report on its condition. Two engineers came out a few weeks later, and investigated. They wrote a memo, and gave it to Moffitt. It concluded that the statue was basically sound, corrosion notwithstanding, and did not recommend any repairs. Moffitt was relieved they&#x2019;d found no damage, but was disappointed that the inspection was solely visual. He was hoping for something more. He&#x2019;d seen the damage himself, and he wanted answers. So on May 20 Moffitt had two of his staff ask the Winterthur Museum, which had examined the Liberty Bell, to determine the &#x201c;causes of the severe corrosion and make suggestions to stabilize the system to avoid catastrophic destruction.&#x201d; They sent two copper samples from Lady Liberty&#x2019;s torch to the museum, and the museum put them in front of Norman Nielsen, a metallurgist at DuPont.<br> <br>Nielsen&#x2019;s report wasn&#x2019;t much more illuminating than the one from Denver. &#x201c;It was hoped,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;that such a study would define the corrosion processes that appear to be causing the copper to deteriorate at an alarming rate and which might suggest measures that might be taken to stabilize the corrosion process.&#x201d; Instead, his investigation, achieved via X-ray fluorescence, merely identified the chemical composition of the copper, its patina, and some of the impurities within, including antimony, lead, silver, zinc, and mercury.<br> <br>Two days before Nielsen finished his report, Drummond&#x2019;s case was heard. It was obvious, by then, that Drummond hadn&#x2019;t put the holes in the statue, and the damage charges were dismissed. After all, Drummond had brought no pitons, and no hammer&#x2014;as was recorded in the report of his arrest, during which his backpack was searched. The banging sound, it turned out, had come from a police officer rapping the butt of his gun on the inside of the statue. But Drummond was convicted of trespassing, a misdemeanor for which he was sentenced to six months of probation and twenty-four hours of community service.<br> <br>A few months later, Moffitt received a phone call from a lawyer representing a couple of French engineers who&#x2019;d just completed the restoration of a similar copper and iron statue, called Vercingetorix. They offered to do a more thorough investigation of the Statue of Liberty, which, after all, had been a gift from France. (It&#x2019;s not surprising that France beat us to the punch; France&#x2019;s history with metal structures is generations older than America&#x2019;s.) Moffitt was all for it, as his questions remained unanswered, and he knew further inquiry would be limited by severely restricted NPS funds. The coincidence was serendipitous, to say the least, as Moffitt had twice suggested the formation of a commission to plan for the statue&#x2019;s upcoming hundredth anniversary, but gotten nowhere, because of budget constraints under President Jimmy Carter. He knew the statue would need to be spiffed up, but nobody, it seemed, wanted to hear about it, much less pay for it. So Moffitt met the engineers at Liberty Island, and arranged for them to meet with the director of the Park Service. A year after Drummond&#x2019;s ascent, they agreed to form a partnership to restore the Statue of Liberty. The years of &#x201c;neglect and deterioration,&#x201d; as the Park Service referred to the 1960s and 1970s at the statue, were about to end. Amazingly, what had begun as an obscure attention-getting stunt by two protesters ended with the most symbolic rust battle in this nation&#x2019;s history.<br> <br><br> <br>The rusting statue&#x2014;once the world&#x2019;s tallest iron structure&#x2014;was a mystery. As seven architects and engineers from France and America began to research her past, they pieced together details. What was clear was that she had been managed, or mismanaged, in a variety of ways, by a mess of agencies. She&#x2019;d been built in 1886, on top of Fort Wood, on Bedloe&#x2019;s Island, and after two weeks of orphanage, was initially overseen by the US Light-House Board, which was part of the Treasury Department. She spent fifteen years in that agency&#x2019;s care, and then twenty-three years under the War Department, before she was declared a national monument. Nine years later she was transferred to the National Park Service. In other words, a half century transpired before anyone with a sense of preservation took over caring for her. One of the first things the NPS did, with the Works Progress Administration, in 1937, was replace parts of her corroded iron frame. Good preservationists, they replaced iron bars with similar iron bars. But, because all of the work was done from the inside of the statue, they used self-tapping screws, rather than rivets. You could say they botched the job. Since then, the statue hadn&#x2019;t received much better care; the monument hadn&#x2019;t had an official superintendent since August 1964. There&#x2019;d been a management assistant, three assistant superintendents, one acting assistant superintendent, a unit manager (none for more than two and a half years), and finally Moffitt, in January 1977.<br> <br>The American half of the team&#x2014;Richard Hayden, Thierry Despont, and Edward Cohen&#x2014;wanted more detail about the statue&#x2019;s past, so they visited other statues built by the statue&#x2019;s architect, Fr�d�ric-Auguste Bartholdi, and its engineer, Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel. They went to the Bartholdi museum, in Colmar, France, to see notes, papers, models, and a journal from 1885. They found no drawings, bu...</p><h2>CSI: A Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Your Literature Review in Communication Studies</h2><p><p><strong>Communication scholars must be inquisitive, seek answers, synthesize information, and make educated decisions &#x2013; similar to being a detective. </strong></p><p>The authors of <strong><em>CSI: A Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Your Literature Review in Communication Studies</em></strong> utilize the CSI theme to provide the reader with a step-by-step process of conceptualizing, reading research, and writing in Communication Studies.</p><p><strong><em>CSI: A Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Your Literature Review in Communication Studies</em></strong> demonstrates an inquisitive, open-minded approach to finding answers, ultimately helping the reader:</p><ul><li>Become a literate information consumer: to understand how to read, interpret, and evaluate information.&nbsp;</li><li>Think about information sources, content, and trends critically.</li><li>Develop problem-solving skills that will help them navigate the rich information environment we live in today.</li><li>Organize ideas and communicating ideas clearly, concisely, and correctly.</li><li>Synthesize and paraphrase properly.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>4 Chair Discipling: Growing a Movement of Disciple-Makers (Like Jesus Series)</h2><p><p>Dann Spader is a&nbsp;disciple-maker who has spent his adult life exploring what it means to take someone from being a seeker to making disciples themselves.

Miller's remarkable book, the Victorian novel has its most dazzling critic in years. . . . Miller's subject is not so much the police in fiction as fiction and policing, narrative as a conservative function of the polis. Tracking diverse strategies of surveillance and incarceration into the confines of the fictional institution itself, Miller investigates Victorian novels as the often unconscious agent of a disciplinary culture. He thus reads fiction reading us, keeping a public in its private place. His mastery of an intricate, layered, and sinuous argument is stunning, the writing no less than superb.

(<i>The New York Times</i>)</p><h2>Aristotle: Politics (Loeb Classical Library No. 264)</h2><p><p>Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious).

Drawing from the Bible, the Pseudepigrapha, the Talmud and Midrash, the kabbalistic literature, medieval folklore, Hasidic texts, and oral lore collected in the modern era, Schwartz has gathered together nearly 700 of the key Jewish myths. The myths themselves are marvelous. We read of Adams diamond and the Land of Eretz (where it is always dark), the fall of Lucifer and the quarrel of the sun and the moon, the Treasury of Souls and the Divine Chariot. We discover new tales about the great figures of the Hebrew Bible, from Adam to Moses; stories about God's Bride, the <em>Shekhinah</em>, and the evil temptress, Lilith; plus many tales about angels and demons, spirits and vampires, giant beasts and the Golem. Equally important, Schwartz provides a wealth of additional information. For each myth, he includes extensive commentary, revealing the source of the myth and explaining how it relates to other Jewish myths as well as to world literature (for instance, comparing Eves release of evil into the world with Pandoras). For ease of use, Schwartz divides the volume into ten books, Myths of God, Myths of Creation, Myths of Heaven, Myths of Hell, Myths of the Holy Word, Myths of the Holy Time, Myths of the Holy People, Myths of the Holy Land, Myths of Exile, and Myths of the Messiah.<br></p><p><br><strong>Howard Schwartz</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. He is the editor of <em>Elijah's Violin &amp; Other Jewish Fairy Tales, Miriam's Tambourine: Jewish Folktales from Around the World, Lilith's Cave: Jewish Tales of the Supernatural</em>, and <em>Gabriel's Palace: Jewish Mystical Tales.</em> <strong>Caren Loebel-Fried</strong> is an award-winning illustrator and author of many works on mythology. Her <em>Hawaiian Legends of the Guardian Spirits</em> received the 2003 Ka Palapala Po`okela Award for Excellence in Illustration.<br><br>"This remarkable work will be of interest to both the scholar and the browser."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"One of those few books that can be cherished and enjoyed by all readers, whether scholars or merely those interested in good stories.... In this massive work, Schwartz gathers nearly seven hundred myths to show that there is, indeed, a Jewish mythology. His selections are wisely and cleverly chosen.... No one in recent times has even attempted to put together such a comprehensive work. In both the collecting and organizing of his material, Schwartz has done a masterful job."--Josepha Sherman, <em>Parabola</em><p></p><br>"Howard Schwartz offers a resounding rebuttal to the old accusation that the Jews have no mythology: hundreds of myths, in an unbroken line from the Tanakh itself to many new, previously untranslated contemporary retellings from the Middle East and throughout the diaspora. <em>Tree of Souls</em> illuminates the mythic elements of stories previously seen as theological or folkloric. Now properly classified as world mythology, they will for the first time be more accurately compared and contrasted with the foundational myths of other cultures. This is that rare book that is both a fascinating read for the non-specialist and a turning point for scholarship." --Wendy Doniger, author of <em>The Woman Who Pretended to Be Who She Was: Myths of Self-Imitation</em><p></p><br>"Beyond any of his other books, in <em>Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism</em> Howard Schwartz offers us his masterwork. If only Joseph Campbell had lived to see it. Schwartz has brought the underground streams of Midrash to the surface for the delight and edification of his academic as well as his popular readers." --Rabbi Zalman M. Schachter-Shalomi, author of <em>Wrapped in a Holy Flame: Teachings and Tales of the Hasidic Masters</em><p></p><br>"Under the complex, meaning-rich, and culturally important heading of 'mythology,' Howard Schwartz provides a beautifully introduced and annotated collection of essential stories and scenes that help to define Judaism in the classical tradition. Schwartz's careful, erudite method of presentation and his excellent selection of texts reveals fine mastery of the material and the pleasingly comparative orientation of the folklorist." --Susan Niditch, author of <em>Ancient Israelite Religion</em><p></p><br>"<em>Tree of Souls</em> promises to shatter the myth that Judaism is mythless. Drawing on primary source texts of the Jewish tradition itself, storyteller Howard Schwartz introduces us to a dimension of this ancient path that has for centuries been overshadowed by attempts at religious correctness and party-line theology. Jewish mythology, Schwartz demonstrates with ample commentaries, is not only a fact, it is the very kernel out of which grew the deepest of Kabbalistic mystery wisdom as well as the most pragmatic of Jewish law and lore. Clearly, Judaism owes its survival to its mythology, and in <em>Tree of Souls</em> Schwartz invites us to discover the mystique, actually the very life force, of this very ancient religion." --Gershon Winkler, author of <em>Magic of the Ordinary: Recovering the Shamanic in Judaism</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Applied Linear Algebra</h2><p><b> </b>This book describes basic methods and algorithms used in modern, real problems likely to be encountered by engineers and scientists - and fosters an understanding of why mathematical techniques work and how they can be derived from first principles. <b> </b> Assumes no previous exposure to linear algebra.

This book handles it very well. It gives full, clear explanations. The style is very good, clear, and thorough. It should appeal to my students. I like the book very much. It subscribes to the same philosophy of linear algebra as pioneered by Strang some 30 years ago (acknowledged in the introduction) and builds on the Strang books, making things even clearer and adding more topics. I would certainly like to use this book and would recommend it to my colleagues.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>-Bruno Harris, Brown University</b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&#x201c;I like the book very much. We will consider it for our linear algebra courses. This is the best new book to appear since the text by Gilbert Strang.

This is a very good book written by a very good mathematician and a very good teacher.&#x201d;</p> <p> <b>-Juan J. Manfredi, University of Pittsburgh</b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&#x201c;In many, if not most, beginning texts of linear algebra, the applications may be collected together in a chapter at the end of the book or in an appendix, leaving any inclusion of this material to the discretion of the instructor. However, <i>Applied Linear Algebra</i> by Olver and Shakiban completely reverses this procedure with a total integration of the application with the abstract theory. The effect on the reader is quite amazing. The reader slowly begins to realize two main points: (1) how applications generally drive the abstract theory, and (2) how the abstract theory can illuminate the applications, and resolve solutions in very striking ways.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This text is easily the best beginning linear algebra text dealing with the applications in an integrated way that I have seen. There is no doubt that this text will be the standard to which all beginning linear algebra texts will be compared.

The examples were very clear and interesting, and they always tried to approach the same problems over and over again as soon sas they had more weapons at their disposal to attack them. I thought this was great, this text introduces the notion of an abstract space very early (still, after Gaussian Elimination) and in a very natural way, then emphasizes along the way over and over again that tremendously. I would absolutely consider this text. I was really taken by the applications and the organization of the materials. I also loved the abundance of exercises and problems.&#x201d;</p> <p> <b>-Tamas Wiandt, Rochester Institute of Technology</b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&#x201c;This text is very well-written, has lots of examples, and is easy to read and learn from.

And through these words, scientists have uncovered many fascinating stories of the physical world. In <em>Stories of the Invisible</em>, Ball has compiled a cornucopia of tales spun by these intriguing, invisible words.<br> Spiced with quotations from Primo Levi, Flann O'Brien, and Thomas Pynchon, <em>Stories of the Invisible</em> takes us on a tour of a world few of us knew existed. The author describes, for instance, the remarkable molecular structure of spider's silk--a material that is pound for pound much stronger the steel--and shows how the Kevlar fibers in bulletproof vests were invented by imitating the alignment of molecules found in the spider's amazing thread. We also learn about the protein molecules that create movement, without which bacteria would be immobile, cells could not divide, there would be no reproduction and therefore no life. The book describes molecules shaped like miniature sculptures, containers, soccer balls, threads, rings, levers and geodesic domes, all made by sticking atoms together. Perhaps most important, Ball provides a fresh perspective on the future of molecular science, revealing how researchers are promising to reinvent chemistry as the central creative science of the 21st century. Indeed, molecular chemists will someday be able to manufacture a synthetic yet living cell and to create machines the size of bacteria, tools which they can then use to assemble new molecules to order. <br> Today we can invent molecules that can cure viral infections, store information, or help hold bridges together. In <em>Stories of the Invisible</em>, Philip Ball takes us inside an incredibly small world that has a major impact on our lives.</p><p>"Molecules," Philip Ball writes, "are the smallest units of meaning in chemistry," the words, if you will, made up of atomic letters. In this lively essay, full of such useful metaphors, Ball shares his longstanding fascination with the unseen world once again, explaining some of the issues that guide modern biochemistry.<p> Consider a sheep, Ball offers, a congeries of "millions of little bits of sheepness." That animal is a blend of molecules, tens of thousands of varieties of them, many of them found in the grass, sky, and water that make up the sheep's environment, many of them shared with other animals and humans. It has been the task of modern chemistry to dissect matter, to tease out underlying structures and commonalities--and, Ball adds, to learn how to make of its constituent elements things that do things, "such as cure viral infections or store information or hold bridges together." How chemistry has done so, making body armor of spider silk and modeling computer networks on "molecular logic," drives Ball's discursive, entertaining, and eminently practical survey.</p><p> A trustworthy explainer of scientific matters to lay readers, Ball writes with clarity and grace--and the more difficult the concept, the better he gets. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Philip Ball</strong> is a science writer and consultant editor for <em>Nature</em>.

You&#39;ll want to try to keep cool in cactus country because the desert gets hot--whew!--really hot. With the sun blazing down from a cloudless sky, you&#39;d think nothing could survive. But watch out, a rattlesnake, scorpion, or tarantula might be near. And beware a little beetle that shoots a foul-smelling spray--while it stands on its head! At any moment, a roadrunner might whiz by, a lizard might pop up, or a tortoise might stick out its head. And always, silently, the yucca and mesquite spread their thirsty roots to find a drink of water.

What they went on to read, however, was not a full &#x201c;life&#x201d; in the modern biographical sense. The battle of Agincourt is the play&#x2019;s main event; every scene leads up to or follows directly from the climax of one of England&#x2019;s most one-sided and famous victories. The play&#x2019;s ambiguous portrayal of war has spurred critical debate for centuries, and its performances have reflected shifting political and cultural views. </p> <p> James D. Mardock&#x2019;s Introduction provides an extensive discussion of <em>Henry V</em>&#x2019;s critical and stage histories and explores the play&#x2019;s complex relationship with other history plays (and with history itself). The appendices provide materials on the play&#x2019;s historical background and sources, as well as documents on contemporary warfare. Additional materials, including an annotated text of the 1600 quarto (Q1) edition, are available on the Internet Shakespeare Editions website. </p> <p> A collaboration between Broadview Press and the Internet Shakespeare Editions project at the University of Victoria, the editions developed for this series have been comprehensively annotated and draw on the authoritative texts newly edited for the ISE.

Its clear, straightforward, and rich annotations make it eminently suitable for the classroom, as do the judiciously compiled appendices of historical documents (as carefully annotated as the play itself). However, it is James D. Mardock&#x2019;s introduction that is the real gem here: although accessible enough for an undergraduate reader, it stands as a gracefully argued, learned, and remarkably acute major piece of criticism in its own right, a genuine contribution to the scholarly debates about <em>Henry V</em>.&#x201d; &#x2015; Holger Syme, University of Toronto </p> <p> &#x201c;Once again the Broadview/Internet Shakespeare editors provide a wonderfully lucid and contextually rich scholarly text. The edition provides well-chosen primary sources to illustrate ideologies of warfare, English/French military practices, Salic law, and many of the interesting material references in the play. With these resources, the Broadview <em>Henry V</em> intelligently engages readers in the world of Shakespeare&#x2019;s drama. An extensive and detailed introduction is particularly thorough on the play&#x2019;s performance history (stage and screen) from its earliest productions to the early 21st century. The play-text itself is admirably set, with helpful glosses and restrained but useful footnotes. The whole edition is nicely balanced between a clean, clear text and a rich border of carefully curated historical information.&#x201d; &#x2015; Elizabeth Hodgson, University of British Columbia </p></p><h2>The Smithsonian Guide to Seaside Plants of the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts: from Louisiana to Massachusetts, Exclusive of Lower Peninsular Florida</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

His travels offer students and lay readers a creative and engaging way to explore many of the major questions in Jesus studies today.

It is a (very hip) college textbook written by an expert: an introduction to New Testament criticism, including the quest for the historical Jesus, the synoptic problem, and so on. It is also a kind of handbook to travel and politics in modern Israel. And finally, it is a novel with a protagonist named Norm on a personal quest for a faith that will hold up in the face of honest questions. . . . What a satisfying read!"<br>--<b>Bruce Hindmarsh</b>, Regent College<br><br>"Students often find the academic study of the Gospels disorienting as they discover a previously unexplored world of literary, historical, and theological questions opening up before them. . . . Fisk proves himself a reliable guide--knowledgeable, candid, steady, and witty--through this territory."<br>--<b>Marianne Meye Thompson</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"A lively romp that combines travelogue with quest narrative. . . . Along the way, we are introduced to the key issues that occupy modern scholars, and we discover why those issues would matter to people in the world today. . . .

These Clan Mothers may be wisdom-keepers, but they are anything but stern and aloof--they are women of joy and grief, risking their hearts and sometimes their lives for those they love. The novel swirls through time, from present-day Minnesota to the Mohawk territory of the 1620s, to the ancient biblical world, brought to life by an indigenous woman who would come to be known as the Virgin Mary.

This book is about shopping for ordinary things. It is also about love and devotion manifest within families and about the nature of sacrificial ritual. A significant contributor to material culture studies, Daniel Miller is an acute observer and an exceptional storyteller. He approaches shopping not as an end in itself but as a means to discover what people's practices, closely observed, reveal about their relationships. </p><p>The ethnographic sections of the book are based on a year's study of shopping on a street in North London. This provides the basis for a sensitive description of how shoppers develop and imagine the social relationships most important to them through the medium of selecting goods. Among the characteristics of these shopping expeditions are the concept of "the treat," and the centrality of thrift. Miller juxtaposes on his account of shopping various theories that anthropologists have brought to bear on the ritual of sacrifice, including that of the French philosopher George Bataille. He then integrates these elements to postulate his theory of shopping as sacrifice in terms as original and as utterly engaging as the stories he tells of individual shoppers.</p></p><p><i>A Theory of Shopping</i> offers a highly original perspective on one of our most basic everyday activities - shopping. We commonly assume that shopping is primarily concerned with individuals and materialism. But Miller rejects this assumption and follows the surprising route of analysing shopping by means of an analogy with anthropological studies of sacrificial ritual. He argues that the act of purchasing goods is almost always linked to other social relations, and most especially those based on love and care. <p>The ethnographic sections of the book are based on a year's study of shopping on a street in North London. This provides the basis for a sensitive description of the issues the shopper confronts when making decisions as to what to buy. Miller develops a theory to account for these observations, arguing that shopping typically consists of three major stages which reflect the three key stages of many rites of sacrifice. In both shopping and sacrifice the ultimate intention is to constitute others as desiring subjects. Finally the book examines certain historical shifts in both subjects and objects of devotion, in particular, ideals of gender and love.</p> <p>This treatment of shopping from the perspective of comparative anthropology represents a highly innovative approach to one of the most familiar tasks of our daily lives. Written in a clear and accessible manner, this book will be of interest to students and academics in anthropology, sociology and cultural studies, as well as anybody who wants to consider more deeply the nature of their own everyday activities.</p><p>Daniel Miller is Professor of Anthropology at the University College of London. His recent books include Capitalism: An Ethnographic Research and Worlds Apart: Modernity through the Prism of the Local.</p></p><h2>When Broadway Went to Hollywood</h2><p>When films like <em>The Jazz Singer</em> started to integrate synchronized music, in the late 1920s many ambitious songwriting pioneers of the Great White Way - George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, and Lorenz Hart, among many others - were enticed westward by Hollywood studios' promises of national exposure and top dollar success. But what happened when writers native to the business of Broadway ran into the very different business of Hollywood? Their movies had their producer despots, their stacking of writing teams on a single project, their use of five or six songs per story where Broadway fit in a dozen, and it seemed as if everyone in Hollywood was uncomfortable with characters bursting into song on the street, in your living room, or in "a cottage small by a waterfall." <br><br>Did the movies give theater writers a chance to expand their art, or did mass marketing ruin the musical's quintessential charm? Is it possible to trace the history of the musical through both stage and screen manifestations, or did Broadway and Hollywood give rise to two wholly irreconcilable art forms? And, finally, did any New York writer or writing team create a film musical as enthralling and timeless as their work for the stage?<br><br>In <em>When Broadway Went to Hollywood</em>, writer and celebrated steward of musical theatre Ethan Mordden directs his unmistakable wit and whimsy to these challenging questions and more, charting the volatile and galvanizing influence of Broadway on Hollywood (and vice versa) throughout the twentieth century. Along the way, he takes us behind the scenes of the great Hollywood musicals you've seen and loved (<em>The Wizard of Oz, Gigi, The Sound of Music, Chicago, West Side Story, The Music Man, Grease</em>) as well as some of the outrageous flops you probably haven't.

Alston Chase's gripping account follows Ted Kaczynski from an unhappy adolescence in Illinois to Harvard, where he was subject not only to the despairing intellectual currents of the Cold War but also to ethically questionable psychological experiments. Kaczynski fled academia to the edge of the wilderness in Montana, but Chase shows us that he was never the wild mountain man the media often assumed him to be. Kaczynski was living in a book-lined cabin just off a main road when he formulated the view of the world that he used to justify murder. Through Chase's compelling narration of the planning and execution of Kaczynski's crimes, we come to know a thoroughly cold-blooded killer, but one whose ideas were uncannily close to those of mainstream America.

Both labor and capital and armies and commodities once moved at the same speed as the information organizing them. Over the last two centuries, social space has developed a strange folded quality, where physical space comes more and more to be doubled by a space of the movement of information. Telesthesia, or perception at a distance, comes increasingly to characterize how we see and hear and know the world.</p> <p>How does the evolution of different communication forms affect how we can perceive and act? How can the underlying infrastructure of communication forms be detected in the events of everyday life? These are the central questions animating this book. McKenzie Wark first explores relations between metropolitan and peripheral cultures &#x2013; or postcolonial relations &#x2013; with close attention to the texture of events that can happen when perception is mediated. He then examines what were once called postmodern experiences, and how relations of communication create new kinds of class relations and experiences of everyday life, from 9/11 to Occupy Wall Street.</p></p><p><b>McKenzie Wark</b> is Professor of Liberal Studies at the New School for Social Research, New York.<p>"An accessible, provocative vision of class politics for a world where the speed of information seems more important than solidity of material objects."<br> <i><b>Media International Australia</b></i><br> <br> "From Sydney to New York, the real to the virtual, the theoretical to the practical and back again, McKenzie Wark charts the vectors of a new space that is neither here nor there and yet is transforming society and the economy in unprecedented ways.

As if her spine were a zipper and someone had come up behind <br>her and unzipped it and pushed his hands into her organs and squeezed, as <br>if they were butter or dough, or grapes to be smashed for wine. At other <br>times it was something sharp like diamonds or shards of glass engraving her <br>bones. Teresa explained these sensations to the doctor &#x2014;the zipper, the <br>grapes, the diamonds, and the glass&#x2014;while he sat on his little stool with <br>wheels and wrote in a notebook. He continued to write after she'd stopped <br>speaking, his head cocked and still like a dog listening to a sound that was <br>distinct, but far off. It was late afternoon, the end of a long day of tests, and <br>he was the final doctor, the real doctor, the one who would tell her at last <br>what was wrong.<br> Teresa held her earrings in the palm of one hand&#x2014;dried violets <br>pressed between tiny panes of glass&#x2014;and put them on, still getting dressed <br>after hours of going from one room to the next in a hospital gown. She <br>examined her shirt for lint and cat hair, errant pieces of thread, and primly <br>picked them off. She looked at Bruce, who looked out the window at a ship in <br>the harbor, which cut elegantly, tranquilly along the surface of the lake, as if <br>it weren't January, as if it weren't Minnesota, as if it weren't ice.<br> At the moment she wasn't in pain and she told the doctor this <br>while he wrote. "There are long stretches of time that I feel perfectly fine," she <br>said, and laughed the way she did with strangers. She confessed that she <br>wouldn't be surprised if she were going mad or perhaps this was the <br>beginning of menopause or maybe she had walking pneumonia. Walking <br>pneumonia had been her latest theory, the one she liked best. The one that <br>explained the cough, the ache. The one that could have made her spine into <br>a zipper.<br> "I'd like to have one more glance," the doctor said, looking up at <br>her as if he had risen from a trance. He was young. Younger. Was he thirty? <br>she wondered. He instructed her to take her clothes off again and gave her a <br>fresh gown to wear and then left the room.<br> She undressed slowly, tentatively at first, and then quickly, <br>crouching, as if Bruce had never seen her naked. The sun shone into the <br>room and made everything lilac.<br> "The light&#x2014;it's so pretty," she said, and stepped up to sit on the <br>examining table. A rosy slice of her abdomen peeped out from a gap in the <br>gown, and she mended it shut with her hands. She was thirsty but not <br>allowed a drop of water. Hungry, from having not eaten since the night <br>before. "I'm starving."<br> "That's good," said Bruce. "Appetite means that you're healthy." <br>His face was red and dry and cracked-looking, as if he'd just come in from <br>plowing the driveway, though he'd been with her all day, going from one <br>section of the hospital to the next, reading what he could find in the waiting <br>rooms. Reading Reader's Digest and Newsweek and Self against his will but <br>reading hungrily, avidly, from cover to cover. Throughout the day, in the small <br>spaces of time in which she too had had to wait, he'd told her the stories. <br>About an old woman who'd been bludgeoned to death by a boy she'd hired to <br>build a doghouse. About a movie star who'd been forced by divorce to sell his <br>boat. About a man in Kentucky who'd run a marathon in spite of the fact that <br>he had only one foot, the other made of metal, a complicated, sturdy coil <br>fitted into a shoe.<br> The doctor knocked, then burst in without waiting for an answer. <br>He washed his hands and brought his little black instrument out, the one with <br>the tiny light, and peered into her eyes, her ears, her mouth. She could smell <br>the cinnamon gum he chewed and also the soap he'd used before he <br>touched her. She kept herself from blinking while staring directly into the <br>bullet of light, and then, when he asked, followed his pen expertly around the <br>room using only her eyes.<br> "I'm not a sickly woman," she declared.<br> Nobody agreed. Nobody disagreed. But Bruce came to stand <br>behind her and rub her back.<br> His hands made a scraping sound against the fabric of the gown, <br>so rough and thick they were, like tree bark. At night he cut the calluses off <br>with a jackknife.<br><br> . . .<br><br>The doctor didn't say cancer&#x2014;at least she didn't hear him say it. She heard <br>him say oranges and peas and radishes and ovaries and lungs and liver. He <br>said tumors were growing like wildfire along her spine.<br> "What about my brain?" she asked, dry-eyed.<br> He told her he'd opted not to check her brain because her ovaries <br>and lungs and liver made her brain irrelevant. "Your breasts are fine," he said, <br>leaning against the sink.<br> She blushed to hear that. Your breasts are fine.<br> "Thank you," she said, and leant forward a bit in her chair. Once, <br>she'd walked six miles through the streets of Duluth in honor of women <br>whose breasts weren't fine and in return she'd received a pink T-shirt and a <br>spaghetti dinner.<br> "What does this mean exactly?" Her voice was reasonable beyond <br>reason. She became acutely aware of each muscle in her face. Some were <br>paralyzed, others twitched. She pressed her cold hands against her cheeks.<br> "I don't want to alarm you," the doctor said, and then, very calmly, <br>he stated that she could not expect to be alive in one year. He talked for a <br>long time in simple terms, but she could not make out what he was saying. <br>When she'd first met Bruce, she'd asked him to explain to her how, <br>precisely, the engine of a car worked. She did this because she loved him <br>and she wanted to demonstrate her love by taking an interest in his <br>knowledge. He'd sketched the parts of an engine on a napkin and told her <br>what fit together and what parts made other parts move and he also took <br>several detours to explain what was likely to be happening when certain <br>things went wrong and the whole while she had smiled and held her face in <br>an expression of simulated intelligence and understanding, though by the end <br>she'd learned absolutely nothing. This was like that.<br> She didn't look at Bruce, couldn't bring herself to. She heard a <br>hiccup of a cry from his direction and then a long horrible cough.<br> "Thank you," she said when the doctor was done talking. "I mean, <br>for doing everything you can do." And then she added weakly, "But. There's <br>one thing&#x2014;are you sure? Because . . . actually . . . I don't feel that sick." <br>She felt she'd know it if she had oranges growing in her; she'd known <br>immediately both times that she'd been pregnant.<br> "That will come. I would expect extremely soon," said the doctor. <br>He had a dimpled chin, a baby face. "This is a rare situation&#x2014;to find it so late <br>in the game. Actually, the fact that we found it so late speaks to your overall <br>good health. Other than this, you're in excellent shape."<br> He hoisted himself up to sit on the counter, his legs dangling and <br>swinging.<br> "Thank you," she said again, reaching for her coat.<br><br>Carefully, wordlessly, they walked to the elevator, pushed its translucent <br>button, and waited for it to arrive. When it did, they staggered onto it and <br>saw, gratefully, that they were alone together at last.<br> "Teresa," Bruce said, looking into her eyes. He smelled like the <br>small things he'd eaten throughout the day, things she'd packed for him in <br>her famously big straw bag. Tangerines and raisins.<br> She put the tips of her fingers very delicately on his face and then <br>he grabbed her hard and held her against him. He touched her spine, one <br>vertebra, and then another one, as if he were counting them, keeping track. <br>She laced one hand into his belt loop at the back of his jeans and with the <br>other hand she held a seashell that hung on a leather string around her neck. <br>A gift from her kids. It changed color depending on how she moved, .ashing <br>and luminescent like a tropical fish in an aquarium, so thin she could crush it <br>in an instant. She considered crushing it. Once, in a quiet rage, she'd <br>squeezed an entire bottle of coconut-scented lotion onto the tops of her <br>thighs, having been denied something as a teenager: a party, a record, a pair <br>of boots. She thought of that now. She thought, Of all the things to think of <br>now. She tried to think of nothing, but then she thought of cancer. Cancer, <br>she said to herself. Cancer, cancer, cancer. The word chugged inside of her <br>like a train starting to roll. And then she closed her eyes and it became <br>something else, swerving away, a bead of mercury or a girl on roller skates.<br><br>They went to a Chinese restaurant. They could still eat. They read the <br>astrology on the placemats and ordered green beans in garlic sauce and cold <br>sesame noodles and then read the placemats again, out loud to each other. <br>They were horses, both of them, thirty-eight years old. They were in perpetual <br>motion, moved with electric fluidity, possessed unconquered spirits. They <br>were impulsive and stubborn and lacked discretion. They were a perfect <br>match.<br> Goldfish swam in a pond near their table. Ancient goldfish. <br>Unsettlingly large goldfish. "Hello, goldfish," she cooed, tilting toward them in <br>her chair. They swam to the surface, opening their big mouths in perfect <br>circles, making small popping noises.<br> "Are you hungry?" she asked them. "They're hungry," she said to <br>Bruce, then looked searchingly around the restaurant, as if to see where they <br>kept the goldfish food.<br> At a table nearby there was a ...</p><h2>Seeking the Historical Cook: Exploring Eighteenth-Century Southern Foodways</h2><p>Seeking the Historical Cook is a guide to historical cooking methods from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century receipt (recipe) books and an examination of how those methods can be used in kitchens today. Designed for adventurous cooks and "foodies," this volume is rich with photographs, period images, and line art depicting kitchen tools and cooking methods. Kay K. Moss invites readers to discover traditional receipts and to experiment with ancestral dishes to brighten today's meals.<br><br>From campfires to modern kitchens, Seeking the Historical Cook is a primer on interpreting the language of early receipts, a practical guide to historical techniques, and a memoir of experiences at historic hearths. Scores of sources, including more than a dozen unpublished personal cookery books, are compared and contrasted with a new look at southern foodways (eating habits and culinary practices). A rather strict interpretive and experiential approach is combined with a friendly and open invitation to the reader to join the ranks of curious cooks. Taken together, these receipts, facts, and lore illustrate the evolution of selected foods through the eighteenth century and beyond.<br><br>After decades of research, experimentation, and teaching in a variety of settings, Moss provides a hands-on approach to rediscovering, re-creating, and enjoying foods from the early South. The book begins by steeping the reader in history, culinary tools, and the common cooking techniques of the time. Then Moss presents a collection of tasteful and appealing southern ancestral receipts that can be fashioned into brilliant heirloom dishes for our twenty-first-century tables. There are dishes fit for a simple backwoods celebration or an elegant plantation feast, intriguing new possibilities for a modern Thanksgiving dinner, and even simple experiments for a school project or for sharing with a favorite child.

It engages with the numerous and complex connotations of the human body in more than 250 artworks by the greatest masters of the Renaissance. Paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, and book illustrations reveal private, sometimes shocking, preoccupations as well as surprising public beliefs&#x2014;the Age of Humanism from an entirely new perspective.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book presents works by Albrecht D�rer, Lucas Cranach, and Martin Schongauer in the north and Donatello, Raphael, and Giorgione in the south; it also introduces names that deserve to be known better.

Can this spirit be found after two millennia? This wise and reassuring book reminds us that the Buddhist meditative tradition, geared to such concerns from its inception, has always been transmitted through texts. A great variety of early writings&#x2014;poems, stories, extended practical guides, commentaries, and chants&#x2014;were purposely designed to pass teachings on from one generation to the next.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sarah Shaw, a longtime practitioner and teacher of Buddhism, investigates a wide and varied range of ancient and later Buddhist writings on meditation. Many of these texts are barely known in the West but, as the author shows, they can be helpful, moving, and often very funny. She begins with early texts of the Pali canon&#x2014;those that describe and involve the Buddha and his followers teaching meditations&#x2014;and moves on to &#x201c;commentaries,&#x201d; with their copious range of practical tips, anecdotes, and accounts of early meditators. The author then considers other early texts that were inspirational as Buddhist traditions spread through India and on to China, Korea, Japan, and Tibet. Centuries after being written, early Buddhist texts have lost none of their relevance, this authoritative book shows. In a tradition characterized by flexibility and mobility, these writings offer wisdom unchanged by time.</p><p><b>Sarah Shaw</b> is honorary fellow, Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, and faculty member, Oriental Institute, Oxford University.

An intense expression of subjective experience? The fictive speech of a specifiable persona? <i>Theory of the Lyric</i> reveals the limitations of these two conceptions of the lyric&#x2015;the older Romantic model and the modern conception that has come to dominate the study of poetry&#x2015;both of which neglect what is most striking and compelling in the lyric and falsify the long and rich tradition of the lyric in the West. Jonathan Culler explores alternative conceptions offered by this tradition, such as public discourse made authoritative by its rhythmical structures, and he constructs a more capacious model of the lyric that will help readers appreciate its range of possibilities.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Theory of the Lyric</i> brings Culler&#x2019;s own earlier, more scattered interventions together with an eclectic selection from others&#x2019; work in service to what he identifies as a dominant need of the critical and pedagogical present: turning readers&#x2019; attention to lyric poems as verbal events, not fictions of impersonated speech. His fine, nuanced readings of particular poems and kinds of poems are crucial to his arguments.

Klinger in his foreword to <em>The New Annotated Frankenstein</em>. Despite its undeniable status as one of the most influential works of fiction ever written, Mary Shelley&#x2019;s novel is often reductively dismissed as the wellspring for tacky monster films or as a cautionary tale about experimental science gone haywire. Now, two centuries after the first publication of <em>Frankenstein</em>, Klinger revives Shelley&#x2019;s gothic masterpiece by reproducing her original text with the most lavishly illustrated and comprehensively annotated edition to date.</p><p>Featuring over 200 illustrations and nearly 1,000 annotations, this sumptuous volume recaptures Shelley&#x2019;s early nineteenth-century world with historical precision and imaginative breadth, tracing the social and political roots of the author&#x2019;s revolutionary brand of Romanticism. Braiding together decades of scholarship with his own keen insights, Klinger recounts <em>Frankenstein</em>&#x2019;s indelible contributions to the realms of science fiction, feminist theory, and modern intellectual history&#x2015;not to mention film history and popular culture. The result of Klinger&#x2019;s exhaustive research is a multifaceted portrait of one of Western literature&#x2019;s most divinely gifted prodigies, a young novelist who defied her era&#x2019;s restrictions on female ambitions by independently supporting herself and her children as a writer and editor.</p><p>Born in a world of men in the midst of a political and an emerging industrial revolution, Shelley crafted a horror story that, beyond its incisive commentary on her own milieu, is widely recognized as the first work of science fiction. The daughter of a pioneering feminist and an Enlightenment philosopher, Shelley lived and wrote at the center of British Romanticism, the &#x201c;exuberant, young movement&#x201d; that rebelled against tradition and reason and "with a rebellious scream gave birth to a world of gods and monsters" (del Toro).</p><p>Following his best-selling <em>The New Annotated H. P. Lovecraft</em> and <em>The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes</em>, Klinger not only considers Shelley&#x2019;s original 1818 text but, for the first time in any annotated volume, traces the effects of her significant revisions in the 1823 and 1831 editions. With an afterword by renowned literary scholar Anne K.

Their bodies were weaker, their minds feebler, their role subservient. No less a scientist than Charles Darwin asserted that women were at a lower stage of evolution, and for decades, scientists&#x2014;most of them male, of course&#x2014;claimed to find evidence to support this.<br><br>Whether looking at intelligence or emotion, cognition or behavior, science has continued to tell us that men and women are fundamentally different. Biologists claim that women are better suited to raising families or are, more gently, uniquely empathetic. Men, on the other hand, continue to be described as excelling at tasks that require logic, spatial reasoning, and motor skills. But a huge wave of research is now revealing an alternative version of what we thought we knew. The new woman revealed by this scientific data is as strong, strategic, and smart as anyone else.<br><br>In <i>Inferior</i>, acclaimed science writer Angela Saini weaves together a fascinating&#x2014;and sorely necessary&#x2014;new science of women. As Saini takes readers on a journey to uncover science&#x2019;s failure to understand women, she finds that we&#x2019;re still living with the legacy of an establishment that&#x2019;s just beginning to recover from centuries of entrenched exclusion and prejudice. Sexist assumptions are stubbornly persistent: even in recent years, researchers have insisted that women are choosy and monogamous while men are naturally promiscuous, or that the way men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s brains are wired confirms long-discredited gender stereotypes.<br><br>As Saini reveals, however, groundbreaking research is finally rediscovering women&#x2019;s bodies and minds. <i>Inferior</i> investigates the gender wars in biology, psychology, and anthropology, and delves into cutting-edge scientific studies to uncover a fascinating new portrait of women&#x2019;s brains, bodies, and role in human evolution.</p><p><b>Angela Saini</b> is an award-winning science journalist whose print and broadcast work has appeared on the BBC and in the <i>Guardian</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, <i>Wired</i>, the <i>Economist</i>, and <i>Science</i>. A former Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT, she won the American Association for the Advancement of Science&#x2019;s Kavli Science Journalism gold award in 2015. Saini has a master&#x2019;s in engineering from Oxford University, and she is the author of <i>Geek Nation: How Indian Science Is Taking Over the World</i>.&#x201c;A brilliant approach to a long overlooked topic, <i>Inferior</i> is impossible to ignore and invaluable.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;The Enlightenment brought revolutions in science, philosophy and art while ushering in respect for human reason over religious faith. But the era also created a narrative about women&#x2014;that they are intellectually inferior to men. Indeed, science itself is an establishment rooted in exclusion, writes science journalist Saini, citing a long history of unrecognized achievement by women scientists: Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin and Emmy Noether, to name a few. The process of science is also riddled with inherent biases that have done nothing to improve society&#x2019;s views of women. Neurosexism, for example, is a term that describes scientific studies that fall back on gender stereotypes. New science and awareness are overturning a great deal of flawed thinking, as Saini shows, but there is still a long way to go.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Andrea Gawrylewski, <i>Scientific American</i><br><br>&#x201c;In this smart, balanced, and wonderfully readable book, Angela Saini breaks the vicious cycle by which women, having been excluded from the sciences by men who assumed them to be inferior, were judged by those same male scientists to be inferior. Study by study, she objectively reexamines what we think we know about the supposed differences between the sexes. If you have ever been shouted down by a male colleague who insists that science has proven women to be biologically inferior to men, here are the arguments you need to demonstrate that he doesn&#x2019;t know what he is talking about.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Eileen Pollack, author of <i>The Only Woman in the Room</i><br><br>&#x201c;Angela Saini&#x2019;s <i>Inferior</i> proves the opposite of its title. It is a lively, well-written, informed account of women&#x2019;s proven powers. She shows that science, long used as a weapon against women, is today an ally in their steady advance. <i>Inferior</i> is another nail in the coffin of male supremacy.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Melvin Konner, author of <i>Women After All</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is an important book that I hope will be widely read. Any time biases are identified and corrected for, it is science and policymaking rather than feminism or any particular ideology that comes out ahead.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, author of <i>The Woman That Never Evolved</i>, <i>Mother Nature</i>, and <i>Mothers and Others</i></p><h2>Articulation and Phonological Disorders: Speech Sound Disorders in Children</h2><p><p> <b>The leading, most current and comprehensive review of information critical to the study of clinical phonology available.</b> </p> <p>Long renowned for providing the most up-to-date, extensive coverage of the clinical literature in the area of speech sound disorders available, this leading resource has earned its status as a classic in the field and its rightful place on every speech, language, and hearing clinician&#x2019;s bookshelf. Readers get an introduction to the normal aspects of speech sound articulation, normal speech sound acquisition, classification and factors related to the presence of speech sound disorders, the assessment and remediation of speech sound disorders, and phonology as it relates to language and dialectal variations. Rather than prescribing a single approach to speech sound disorders, the authors present a range of perspectives on the nature, assessment and treatment of these disorders. <i>Articulation and Phonological Disorders</i> is primarily concerned with those disorders not etiologically associated with known or obvious sensory, structural or neuromotor deficits.

Quantitatively oriented managers have used them to control the month-to-month variation in the <i>differences</i> between the returns to their stock portfolios and the returns to the stock indices to which they are benchmarked. These models employ a wide variety of ad hoc factors that have been shown to be effective in predicting the risk of a stock portfolio. </p> <p> Factor models have also been widely discussed in academic finance. Finance professors have long searched for the factors that account for the extent to which returns are correlated stock to stock. The professors have correctly concluded that the correlations can be <i>explained</i> by a few factors, such as unexpected changes in industrial production, inflation, or interest rates. This is not to say that these few factors can match the success of the wide variety of ad hoc factors used in the business for <i>forecasting</i> risk. </p> <p> The professors have also used factor models to explain why stocks have differential expected returns. These models are theoretical in nature, and are derived under the assumption that pricing in the stock market is efficient and rational. If it is not, a wide variety of ad hoc factors may be useful in explaining and predicting expected stock returns. </p> <p> Until recently, ad hoc factor models have not been employed to predict the expected return to stock portfolios. Surprisingly, the factor models are much more powerful in predicting expected return than they are in predicting risk. The purpose of this book is to demonstrate and explain the nature of this power. </p> <p> I wish to thank Teimur Abasov, David Friese, and David Olson for research assistance.

This text provides a comprehensive treatment of how Germany and Austria-Hungary - two of the key belligerents - conducted the war and what defeat meant to them. How did the Hohenzollern and Habsburg empires conceive of and conduct &#34;total war&#34;? What impact did the prolonged fighting have on their societies? Drawing on his own archival research over the past decade, Holger Herwig analyzes why Vienna opted for war in 1914 and why Berlin took the calculated risk to back that decision. The war plans and military campaigns on both Eastern and Western fronts are examined in detail and key battles, some of the bloodiest and most wasteful in military history, are narrated and analyzed. On the home front, the mobilization of the civilian populations behind the war effort had profound social consequences. The militarization of the key war-related industries led to an industrial women&#39;s labour force emerging in both countries, deeply affecting the role of women in Germanic society.</p><p>A new edition of the definitive military history of Germany and Austria-Hungary during the First World WarThe Great War toppled four empires, cost the world 24 million dead, and sowed some of the seeds of another worldwide conflagration 20 years later. Yet, until now, there has been no comprehensive treatment of how Germany and Austria-Hungary - two of the key belligerents - conducted the war and what defeat meant to them. Much of the writing on the war has hallowed the tactical and operational effectiveness of the German army. Yet Germany lost the conflict. In tackling this paradox, Herwig shows how greatly the Central Powers suffered from inadequate resources and an incapacity to manage effectively what they had. He also shows with clarity just how much of Germany&#39;s effort was expended in sustaining not only its own war effort but also that of its ally, without any corresponding subordination of Vienna to Berlin, as the economic and military realities required. But it is in his reassessment of Germany&#39;s military effectiveness that he offers the most fundamental corrective. For readers accustomed to criticisms of the various Allied commanders, Herwig&#39;s examination of the German military effort will have uncanny echoes. Even the famous German offensives of March 1918, regarded as a model of breakthrough operations by interwar theorists, are condemned not just for their lack of strategic objective but even for their tactical failings.</p><h2>Helping Children with Aggression and Conduct Problems: Best Practices for Intervention</h2><p>This eminently practical book thoroughly describes the most effective interventions for 3- to 12-year-olds with aggression and conduct problems.

Geographically, these diseases have spread across the entire globe; temporally, they stretch from the sixth century to the present. John Aberth considers not only the varied impact that disease has had upon human history but also the many ways in which people have been able to influence diseases simply through their cultural attitudes toward them. The author argues that the ability of humans to alter disease, even without the modern wonders of antibiotic drugs and other medical treatments, is an even more crucial lesson to learn now that AIDS, swine flu, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and other seemingly incurable illnesses have raged worldwide. Aberth&#39;s comparative analysis of how different societies have responded in the past to disease illuminates what cultural approaches have been and may continue to be most effective in combating the plagues of today.</p><p>John Aberth holds a PhD in medieval history from the University of Cambridge and is the author of numerous books on disease and the Middle Ages.Medieval historian Aberth presents interactions of humans and epidemics in case studies of six infectious diseases: plague, smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, influenza, and AIDS. He chose these because they have known pathogens, can be fatal, and have had long histories. Not merely narrative or descriptive, his study is an attempt to demonstrate how human reactions and attitudes to these diseases have in turn shaped how they affect human communities. Going beyond an exercise in the social construction of disease, Aberth's historical focus on the interaction of disease and human response leads him to be optimistic about human abilities to adjust to and even neutralize biomedical effects. The longest chapter, on the plague, reflects the author's professional specialty. The second longest chapter is on AIDS; remaining chapters are 9-24 pages. Aberth's detailed attention to Islamic understandings of and reactions to plague is especially welcome. He opens each chapter by describing the disease and its effects, then for each disease develops unique reactions and attitudes as well as points introduced earlier, weaving an overall pattern of human progress and intransigence, of connections made and opportunities missed. Summing Up: Highly recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>The prospect of a slender volume about plagues in world history would certainly be attractive to all those who teach either disease history or world history. Moreover . . . it is an approach that most students would embrace. (<i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>)<br><br>John Aberth offers a social interpretation of disease throughout history using a comparative global framework. He has a lively writing style, and each chapter is framed by lucid summary descriptions of disease symptoms, progression, transmission, treatments, and the respective debates. Plagues in World History should be a profitable and successful textbook for undergraduate students and general readers. (<i>Journal of World History</i>)<br><br>The author presents an effective case for the diseases he has chosen and provides the reader with current findings that allow for interpretations of disease origins. (<i>The Historian</i>)<br><br>John Aberth's admirable work on this topic, Plagues in World History, deserves to be engaged with by anyone who is interested in pandemics throughout time. . . .The reader will be most impressed by the wealth of information about the various pandemics and the efforts by medical researchers to combat them up to today . . . [The author] persues his topic from a remarkably balanced position. . . .Both historians and medical researchers will find this book a fascinating read, an excellent digestion of what we know today about plagues in world history. (<i>The Sixteenth Century Journal</i>)<br><br>John Aberth has written a concise book that is both well-informed and clear about contemporary medical understandings of epidemics, and steadily conscious of their broader historical, political, social, and economic contexts. In an age when such epidemics as malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS affect millions, Aberth's arguments have continuing importance. (J. N. Hays, Loyola University, Chicago)<br><br>Seeking understanding of our societies and selves by reading and writing books that omit all mention of the essential fact of wars would strike us as a glaring oversight. Yet our shelves are crammed with books that never mention epidemics, an equally vital force in human history. <i>Plagues in World History</i> is the authoritative and fascinating antidote to that error.

Featuring previously unpublished material, it also includes Goldberg's plans for unrealized projects as well as his collaborations with other prominent modern architects, such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Buckminster Fuller.&nbsp; </p><p>Goldberg's interest in the social dimension of architecture was reflected in many of his cutting-edge designs. In 1959, he conceived the plan for his most iconic structure, the sixty-story Marina City residential towers, in the heart of downtown Chicago. He created a number of hospitals that offered a new paradigm for how patients and staff interacted within the space. Goldberg's progressive designs also extended to schools, prefabricated structures, and furniture.</p></p><p><b>Zo� Ryan</b> is John H.

Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>Seneca: Phaedra (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)</h2><p>Seneca&#39;s Phaedra occupies an important and influential position in the tradition of European drama.

Intended for both undergraduate and graduate students in social work, it aims to articulate the depth of the subject by introducing students to the philosophical, political, and sociological theories that inform community organizing and advocacy. These topics are explored in detail through such examples as the labour movement, environmental organizing, feminist movements, and faith-based movements as a way to inform social work community practice. The author emphasizes the importance of a thorough understanding of why and how people get together to effect change in their own communities. Ongoing debates and controversies that face organizers and advocates in the social work profession are also considered.</p> <p>Each chapter includes relevant discussion questions for reflection, as well as a list of useful books and websites for further inquiry. Also included are numerous case studies from community efforts in Post-Katrina New Orleans, many of which the author has been involved in herself, providing a recent and widely recognized series of real world examples that will be easily accessible for students and professors around the world.</p></p><p>University at Albany, State University of New York, USA<em>"</em>Progressive Community Organizing <em>is that most unusual and welcome of contributions to the world of social work scholarship...[it] represents a new and vital direction for social work...If you read one book on organizing this year, I would recommend that you consider Pyles's pulsing work.

The first of these, fought 1904-1905 over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea, ended in a clear-cut Japanese victory.<br><br>Following the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, in 1931, Japan turned its interest to nearby Soviet territories. The result was a series of border incidents &#x2013; starting with the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938. Maintaining that the border between their proxy-state, Manchukuo, and the Soviet-dominated Mongolian People&#x2019;s Republic was the Khalkhyn Gol (or Khalkha River), the Japanese deployed some of best units of their army to occupy and secure this area.<br><br>Following a military build-up, a series of bitter clashes took place mid-May and June 1939, after which the Japanese launched an all-out assault in July.

Although continuing to underestimate their opponents, the Japanese introduced a major reform of their army. Furthermore, after realizing the massive material disparity vis-�-vis the former USSR, Tokyo joined the Axis with Nazi Germany and Italy.</p><p>Brendan Hulley is a writer with a career as a forensic accountant and auditor for the Australian Federal Government.

They also offer a candid look at the writing life--the rejection letters, not one but two negative reviews in the New York Times for the same book, writing in the morning or at night and worrying about money during the long afternoons.</p><p>Salter raises the question, Why does one write? For wealth? For admiration, or a sense of "importance"? Confronting a blank sheet that always offers too many choices, practicing a vocation that often demands one write instead of live, the answer for Salter was creating a style that captured experience, in a world where anything not written down fades away.</p><p></p><p>Kapnick Foundation Distinguished Writer-in-Residence Lectures</p></p><p><p>James Salter was the acclaimed author of the novels <i>A Sport and a Pastime, Light Years, and All That Is,</i> the memoir <i>Burning the Days,</i> and the PEN/Faulkner Award-winning collection <i>Dusk and Other Stories.</i> He was the first Kapnick Foundation Distinguished Writer&#x2013;in&#x2013;Residence at the University of Virginia, a position inspired by William Faulkner&#x2019;s residency at the university in 1956&#x2013;58.</p><p>A confident precision is always there--whether Jim is writing about sexual longing, or when his subject is flying combat missions in Korea. What Jim believed, he was always able to express succinctly: 'Style is the entire writer.' These lectures make me miss him--his generous but undoubting voice.</p> (John Irving)<br><br><p>A last and very generous gift from the great James Salter. The reader feels his reverence for literature on every page, as well as his legendary precision. Any aspiring writer should read this book, if only to get a taste of how a master thinks and feels: specifically, poetically, always mindful of the necessary mystery at the heart of great art.</p> (George Saunders)<br><br><p>This is a slender book, but anyone who reveres the work of James Salter &#x2015; a sodality that includes John Irving, Richard Ford, George Saunders and John Casey&#x2015; will want to read it and keep it around. Here one of the great prose stylists of our time reflects on writing, favorite authors (Isaac Babel, Nabokov, Bellow), and the connection between life and fiction. Salter closes with his epigraph to his last novel, <i>All That Is</i>: 'There comes a time when you realize that everything is a dream, and only those things preserved in writing have any possibility of being real.'</p> (<i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br><p></p><br><br><p>[R]eaders will be inspired and heartened by Salter's candid thoughts on the inevitable rejection, criticism, and struggle with best practices that accompany the writer's life. Salter also shares the books and authors that informed him throughout the years, and his personal beliefs in the value of the written word.</p> (<i>Poets &amp; Writers</i>)</p><h2>The Screwtape Letters</h2><p><p>A masterpiece of satire, this classic has entertained and enlightened readers the world over with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life from the vantage point of Screwtape, a highly placed assistant to "Our Father Below." At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C. S. Lewis gives us the correspondence of the �worldly-wise old devil to his nephew Wormwood, a novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man. <em>The Screwtape Letters</em> is the most engaging and humorous account of temptation&#x2014;and triumph over it&#x2014;ever written.</p></p><p>This adaptation of C.S. Lewis's biting satire received a 1999 Grammy nomination for best spoken-word performance, and it's easy to see why--the story fits the format perfectly. It's relatively brief (the unabridged reading takes a mere four hours), and contains only one character--the demon Screwtape, who writes letters to his novice nephew Wormwood, instructing him on how to best tempt his "patient" (a wayward soul on earth) into the bosom of "our Lord below." <p> Obviously, the book wasn't written with former Monty Python John Cleese in mind, but it's hard to imagine a better Screwtape. Cleese's voice provides the perfect vehicle for Lewis's dry, razor-edged wit. His uncanny comic timing and ability to milk each phrase for maximum effect betray an infectious enthusiasm for the story. It's clear that he's having a great time reading, and it's impossible not to laugh along with him. This inspired pairing of two of the 20th century's greatest wits makes for a meditation on the dark side of spiritual guidance that's as relevant and funny today as it was in Lewis's war-torn England. (Running time: 4 hours, 3 cassettes) --<i>Andrew Neiland</i></p>His letters are signed, save one, "Your affectionate uncle", yet Uncle Screwtape's purposes in writing to his young nephew are hardly innocent. Penned in a brisk, businesslike style, old Screwtape offers the gullible Tempter Wormword fiendishly clever advice on his most pressing concern: the winning of young lives to the devil.<p>First published in 1941, The Screwtape Letters, a perennial best seller, has earned a place in the library of classics. The truths contained in C. S. Lewis's treatise on human nature are as old as the world, but his witty observations continue to confront and challenge believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>The outcome of Screwtape's correspondence is not known. But judging from his final signoff -- "Your increasingly and ravenously affectionate uncle" -- his appetite for evil has not lessened.</p></p><h2>Carnival Evening: New and Selected Poems 1968-1998</h2><p><p><strong>"Linda Pastan is one of America's truly fine poets working at the height of her powers." &#x2015; Michael Collier, <em>Baltimore Sun</em></strong></p> This volume brings together new work along with poems gathered from nine previous collections. When Linda Pastan's first book was published in 1971, the <em>Jerusalem Post</em> wrote, she "in large measure fulfilled Emerson's dream &#x2015; the revelation of &#x2018;the miraculous in the common.' " Since then Pastan has continued to explore the complexities, passion, and dangers under the surfaces of ordinary life. "Some critics point to Emily Dickinson when citing Pastan's lapidary style and metaphysical wit, a comparison that does justice to either poet when Pastan is at her best." &#x2015; <em>Gettysburg Review</em>&nbsp; "Pastan's unfailing mastery of her medium holds the darkness firmly in check." &#x2015; <em>New York Times Book Review</em> National Book Award finalist&nbsp; Linda Pastan was Poet Laureate of Maryland from 1991 to 1993.</p><p>Linda Pastan's many awards include the Maurice English Award, the Radcliffe College Distinguished Alumni Award, and the 2003 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. The former poet laureate of Maryland, she is the author of fourteen books of poetry&#x2015;the latest of which, Insomnia, won the Towson University Prize for Literature.

In a moving drama constructed from her observations of leukemic children, aged three to nine, in a hospital ward, she shows how the children come to know they are dying, how and why they attempt to conceal this knowledge from their parents and the medical staff, and how these adults in turn try to conceal from the children their awareness of the child's impending death.</p></p><p>"[A] convincing case for training of health professionals dealing with the terminally ill while recognizing the social constraints upon all involved. This is an exceptional and sympathetic study.'" (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Winner of the 1997 Charles A.

After Caesar, the Gauls exchanged their tribal quarrels for Roman values and acquired the paraphernalia of civilized urban life. The Romans also left behind a legacy of language, literature, law, government, religion, architecture, and industry.<br><br> Each chapter of <em>Caesar's Footprints</em> is dedicated to a specific journey of exploration through Roman Gaul. From the amphitheatres of Arles and N�mes to the battlefield of Ch�lons (where Flavius Aetius defeated Attila the Hun) Bijan Omani&#x2015;an exciting and authoritative new voice in Roman history&#x2015;explores archaeological sites, artifacts, and landscapes to reveal how the imprint of Roman culture shaped Celtic France&#x2015;and thereby helped to create modern Europe. 16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Bijan Omrani attended Lincoln College, Oxford. His first book, Ticking Tom and the Tornado, was published when he was 10 years old, which he followed with contributions to The Spectator as an undergraduate. His research interests include Euripides, mysticism, Henry Purcell and the history of the Afghan-Pakistan frontier. He is the author and editor of various works on Central Asia including Asia Overland: Tales of Travel on the Trans-Siberian and Silk Road (Odyssey Books &amp; Guides), and also a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Royal Geographical Society. He teaches Classics at Westminster School.&#x201c;A stimulating history. Omrani displays the facility of a poet, waxing eloquent on the beauty of sites where the Roman influence in Gaul forcefully asserted itself. This book is as much a travelogue as it is a wonderfully simplified lesson on Julius Caesar and his successors. The author effectively shows the full effects of the Roman occupation. His electric excitement is consistently contagious. A book for all lovers of ancient history, with something to learn or love on nearly every page.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Omrani writes with a free-flowing narrative style. His engaging historical journey includes descriptions of Gaul prior to Roman involvement and continues to trace Roman conquest in the area and its adaptation to Roman influences. An easy read for those interested in exploring broader cultural and historical connections during the Roman transition into the European continent and its continuing impact on the region.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An educational and enjoyable tour of the ancient Gallo-Roman society that grew out of the ashes of Caesar&#x2019;s conquest.

Entertaining and edifying.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Criterion</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A poetic sense for spirit of place. <em>Caesar&#x2019;s Footprints</em> is a learned and romantic reflection on France&#x2019;s Roman past, one suffused with affection for its present.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Times Literary Supplement (London)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bijan Omrani is an exciting and authoritative new voice in Roman history. &nbsp;<em>Ceasar&#x2019;s Footprints</em> is an extraordinary tour of the legacy of Roman culture in Gaul.

It pulls no punches on the shocking violence and naked self-interest of Caesar&#x2019;s northern wars, but is equally candid on the ways he laid the foundations of the medieval and modern West.&nbsp;Striding from Marseille and Arles to Autun and Deal in Kent, the book grippingly blends the unified world the Romans created with the landscapes and cultures two thousand years on. It is a bold vision, elegantly evocative, and an accomplished tribute to year zero of our shared modern European identity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dominic Selwood</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Without the conquests of Caesar there would have been no Roman Empire &#x2013; and, so many of us believe, no continuing Freudian impulse for a European Union today. This terrific account lays bare the horror and cruelty of Caesar's campaigns &#x2013; as well as the astonishing achievements of the Romans. Bursting with anecdotes and fizzing with unexpected information, <em>Caesar's Footprints</em> compels us to ask &#x2013; how much does our continent owe to one man and his naked and cynical lust for glory.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Boris Johnson, British Foreign Secretary</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is a wonderful evocation of how Rome civilised Gaul and through Gaul laid the foundations for European civilisation.&nbsp;Omrani&#x2019;s golden pen produces prose that is a pleasure to read.&nbsp; He is a polymath who delights us with his learning &#x2013; in literature, history and geography &#x2013; but wears it lightly.

The book&#x2019;s unique blend of intellectual, religious, and social history offers perspectives on the movement&#x2019;s leaders as well as its followers, and demonstrates that, far from being a throwback to the Middle Ages, Hasidism is a product of modernity that forged its identity as a radical alternative to the secular world.</p><p>Hasidism originated in southeastern Poland, in mystical circles centered on the figure of Israel Ba'al Shem Tov, but it was only after his death in 1760 that a movement began to spread. Challenging the notion that Hasidism ceased to be a creative movement after the eighteenth century, this book argues that its first golden age was in the nineteenth century, when it conquered new territory, won a mass following, and became a mainstay of Jewish Orthodoxy. World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Holocaust decimated eastern European Hasidism. But following World War II, the movement enjoyed a second golden age, growing exponentially.

In this sweeping, ambitious look at a thousand years of Western experience, Robert Friedel argues that technological change comes largely through the pursuit of improvement&#x2015;the deep-rooted belief that things could be done in a better way. What Friedel calls the "culture of improvement" is manifested every day in the ways people carry out their tasks in life&#x2015;from tilling fields and raising children to waging war.</p><p>Improvements can be ephemeral or lasting, and one person's improvement may not always be viewed as such by others. Friedel stresses the social processes by which we define what improvements are and decide which improvements will last and which will not. These processes, he emphasizes, have created both winners and losers in history.</p><p>Friedel presents a series of narratives of Western technology that begin in the eleventh century and stretch into the twenty-first. Familiar figures from the history of invention are joined by others&#x2015;the Italian preacher who described the first eyeglasses, the dairywomen displaced from their control over cheesemaking, and the little-known engineer who first suggested a grand tower to Gustav Eiffel. Friedel traces technology from the plow and the printing press to the internal combustion engine, the transistor, and the space shuttle. Friedel also reminds us that faith in improvement can sometimes have horrific consequences, as improved weaponry makes warfare ever more deadly and the drive for improving human beings can lead to eugenics and even genocide. The most comprehensive attempt to tell the story of Western technology in many years, engagingly written and lavishly illustrated, <i>A Culture of Improvement </i>documents the ways in which the drive for improvement has shaped our modern world.</p></p><p>Robert Friedel is Professor in the Department of History at the University of Maryland.

This richly detailed book provides for the first time a complete history of childhood in England from about the year 1000 to the sixteenth century. <br><br>Leading medieval historian Nicholas Orme draws together a vast range of sources and disciplines&#x2015;history, literature, religion, and art&#x2015;to create a picture of medieval childhood more comprehensive than ever before. Beginning with pregnancy and childbirth, Orme explores the succeeding stages of a child&#x2019;s growth to adulthood. He discusses baptism, the significance of birthdays and ages, and family life, including upbringing, food, clothes, sleep, and the plight of the poor. He also chronicles the misfortunes of childhood, from disablement, abuse, and accidents to illness and death. In a fascinating review of the special culture of children, the author describes their rhymes, toys, and games; their religion and relationship to the Church; and their learning to read the literature for children. The final chapter of the book explains how adolescents grew up and entered the adult world.<br><br>In this vivid recreation of childhood in the middle ages, Orme underscores the importance medieval society attached to childhood.

For several years he lived there and painted, and when he came across familiar motifs in the countryside, he took snapshots of the setting. These photographs assisted Loran in his analysis of C�zanne&#39;s composition and served as the basis for this book, which analyzes over 30 of C�zanne&#39;s paintings. This new edition brings Loran&#39;s milestone study up-to-date with a new foreword by art historian Richard Shiff, who places Loran&#39;s work into today&#39;s art historical context.</p><p><i>Praise for the first edition:</i><br><br> I have learned a great deal from his book about modern painting in general.

Are there times when one plus one can equal three and not two? Yes&#x2013;if you add one unicorn and one goat, you get three horns. Can one plus one ever equal five? Yes, because when you add one set of triplets and one set of twins, you get five babies. After sharing the numerous examples provided, children can be asked to stretch their imaginations and come up with their own quirky equations. Sexton's brightly colored digitally rendered cartoonlike illustrations are not only cheerful and attractive, but they also provide subtle clues. For example, in the one plus one equals three problem, the unicorn and the goat are seated in the library, one reading a book on mythical beasts, one reading a book on barnyard buddies. The horns are obscured by the equation itself, and are then revealed on the next page. Observant children will enjoy playing detective. The book can be read independently but would also be fun to share with a group. A great way to encourage outside-the-box thinking.<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

This carefully organized, very readable text covers every essential topic in discrete mathematics in a logical fashion. Placing each topic in context, it covers concepts associated with discrete mathematical systems that have applications in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The author introduces more basic concepts at the freshman level than are found in other texts, in a simple, accessible form. Introductory material is balanced with extensive coverage of graphs, trees, recursion, algebra, theory of computing, and combinatorics. Extensive examples throughout the text reinforce concepts.</p><p>Preface <p> While there are many discrete mathematics books on the market, none of the available books covers the desired range and depth of topics in discrete mathematics in this book and also works in a theme on how to do proofs. Proofs are introduced in the first chapter and continued throughout the book. Most students taking discrete mathematics are mathematics and computer science majors. While the necessity of learning to do proofs is obvious for mathematics majors, it is also critical for computer science students to think logically. Essentially a logical bug-free computer program is equivalent to a logical proof. Also it is assumed in this book that it is easier to use (or at least not misuse) an application if one understands why it works. With few exceptions, the book is self-contained. Concepts are developed mathematically before they are seen in an applied context. </p><p> Calculus is not required for any of the material in this book. College algebra is adequate for the basic chapters. However, although this book is self-contained, some of the remaining chapters require more mathematical maturity than the basic chapters. </p><p> This book is intended for either a one- or two-term course in discrete mathematics. The first eight chapters of this book provide a solid foundation in discrete mathematics and would be appropriate for a first-level course at the freshman or sophomore level. These chapters are essentially independent so that the instructor can pick the material he wishes to cover. The remainder of the book contains appropriate material for a second course in discrete mathematics. These chapters expand concepts introduced earlier and introduce numerous advanced topics. Topics are explored from different points of view to show how they may be used in different settings. The range of topics includes </p><p> Logic&#x2014;Including truth tables, propositional logic, predicate calculus, circuits, induction, and proofs. </p><p> Set Theory&#x2014;Including cardinality of sets, relations, partially ordered sets, congruence relations, graphs, directed graphs and functions. </p><p> Algorithms&#x2014;Including complexity of algorithms, search and sort algorithms, the Euclidean algorithm, Huffman's algorithm, Prim's algorithms, Warshall's algorithm, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithms. </p><p> Graph Theory&#x2014;Including directed graphs, Euler cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles and paths, planar graphs, and weighted graphs. </p><p> Tree&#x2014;Including binary search trees, weighted trees, tree transversal, Huffman's codes, and spanning trees. </p><p> Combinatorics&#x2014;Including permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion, partitions, generating functions, Catalan numbers, Sterling numbers, Rook polynomials, derangements, and enumeration of colors. </p><p> Algebra&#x2014;Including semigroups, groups, lattices, semilattices, Boolean algebras, rings, fields, integral domains, polynomials, and matrices. </p><p> There is extensive number theory and algebra in this book. I feel that this is a strength of this text, but realize that others may not want to cover these subjects. The chapters in these areas are completely independent of the remainder of the book and can be covered or not as the instructor desires. This book also contains probability, finite differences, and other topics not usually found in a discrete mathematics text. ORGANIZATION </p><p> The first three chapters cover logic and set theory. It is assumed in this book that an understanding of proofs is necessary for the logical construction of advanced computer programs. </p><p> The basic concepts of a proof are given and illustrated with numerous examples. In Chapter 2, the student is given the opportunity to prove some elementary concepts of set theory. In Chapter 3, the concept of an axiom system for number theory is introduced. The student is given the opportunity to prove theorems in a familiar environment. Proofs using induction are also introduced in this chapter. Throughout the remainder of the book, many proofs are presented and many of the problems are devoted to proofs. Problems, including proofs, begin at the elementary level and continually become more advanced throughout the book. </p><p> Relations and graphs are introduced in Chapter 2. Relations lead naturally into functions, which are introduced in Chapter 4. However, the development of functions in Chapter 4 is independent of the material in Chapter 2. Similarly the development of graphs in Chapter 6 does not depend on their development as relations in Chapter 2. </p><p> Matrices, permutations, and sequences are introduced in Chapter 4 as special types of functions. Further properties of functions and matrices follow in Chapter 6. Algorithms for matrices are introduced and further properties of matrices are developed, which will be used in later chapters on algebra, counting, and theory of codes. </p><p> Permutations are used for counting in Chapter 8 and also for applications in algebra and combinatorics in later chapters. Again the material in Chapter 8, while related to Chapter 4, can be studied independently. </p><p> Chapter 5 is independent of the previous chapters except for the matrices in the previous chapter. Algorithms are developed including sorting algorithms. The complexity of algorithms is also developed in this chapter. Prefix and suffix notation are introduced here. They are again discussed in Chapter 15 with regard to traversing binary trees. Binary and hexadecimal numbers are also introduced in this chapter. </p><p> Many elementary concepts of graphs, directed graphs, and trees are covered in Chapter 6. These concepts are covered in more depth in Chapters 14-16. Chapter 6 is independent of the previous chapters. </p><p> In Chapters 7 and 9 the basics of number theory are developed. These chapters are necessary for applications of number theory in Chapter 23 but are otherwise completely independent of the other chapters and may be omitted if desired. </p><p> Chapter 8 is the beginning of extensive coverage of combinatorics. This is continued in many of the chapters including Chapters 12, 13, and 17. Chapter 8 also covers probability, which is not common in most other discrete mathematics books. </p><p> Chapters 9 and 20 cover the basic concepts of algebra including semigroups, groups rings, semilattices, lattices, rings, integral domains, and fields. These chapters use Sections 3.6 and 4.3 for examples of groups and rings. Chapter 9 is necessary for the applications in Chapters 17-21. </p><p> In many ways Chapters 11, 12, and 13 form a package. Recursion is continued in Chapter 11. In addition to the standard linear recurrence relations normally covered in a discrete mathematics text, the theory of finite difference is also covered. Chapter 6 should be covered before this chapter unless the student already has some knowledge of recursion. Chapter 12 continues the counting introduced in Chapter 8. It covers topics introduced in Chapter 8 such as occupancy problems and inclusion-exclusion. It also introduces derangements and rook polynomials. It is closely related to Chapter 11. Many of the same topics are covered from different points of view. One example of this is Stirling numbers. However neither chapter is dependent on the other. </p><p> Chapters 11 and 12 are tied together in Chapter 13, where generating functions are used to continue the material in both chapters. In particular, generating functions provide a powerful tool for the solution of occupancy problems. </p><p> Chapters 14-16 continue the study of trees and graphs begun in Chapter 6. They obviously depend on the material in Chapter 6, but are virtually independent of most of the preceding chapters. One exception is the use of matrices in some of the algorithms. Many of the standard topics of Graphs and Trees are covered including planar graphs, Hamiltonian cycles, binary trees, spanning trees, minimal spanning trees, weighted trees, shortest path algorithms, and network flows. </p><p> Chapters 17-23 form another cluster consisting of number theory, algebra, combinatorics and their application. The theory of computation is introduced in Chapter 17. This includes codes, regular languages, automata, grammars and their relationship. This chapter uses semigroups from Section 9.2. Chapter 18 introduces special codes such as error detecting codes and error correcting codes. This chapter requires knowledge of group theory, found in Section 9.4 and a knowledge of matrices, found in Chapters 4 and 5. Codes are explored from yet another direction in Chapter 23 where cryptography is introduced. This chapter is dependent on the previous chapters on number theory. </p><p> In Chapter 19, algebra and combinatorics are combined for the development of Burnside's Theorem and Polya's Theorem for the enumeration of colors. It primarily depends on a knowledge of permutations found in Section 9.4 </p><p> Chapter 21 is a simple application of groups and semigroups and their mapping onto the complex plane. The prerequisites for this chapter are Sections 9.2 and 9.4. </p><p> Chapter 22 gives three important applications of number theory. The study of Hashing functions and cryptography is particularly relevant to computer science. </p><p> When teaching a beginning course, I normally cover Chapters 1-5 in their entirety, Sections 8.1-8.3 and try to cover the first three sections of Chapter 6. As mentioned previously, the material in the first eight chapters is arranged for maximal flexibility.

In turn, the 1980s ushered in a second wave of new movements&#x2014;neoexpressionism, media deconstruction, and commodity art. Sandler also discusses postmodernist art theory, the art market, and consumer society, providing an essential framework for understanding the art of this period.Unlike his previous books, <i>Art of the Postmodern Era</i> includes both American and European artists.</p><p><b>Irving Sandler,</b> professor of art history at the State University of New York at Purchase, was born in New York City and educated in Philadelphia. He is the author of a multivolume history of American art since 1945, books on Alex Katz, Al Held, Mark di Suvero, and numerous exhibition catalogs, articles, and reviews.A luminary critic, Sandler (art history SUNY, Purchase) specializes in American art from Abstract Expressionism onward. His lengthy but informative new book charts the tremendous diversity of the counterculture decades, defining both the myriad art movements and the fascinating ups and downs of squabbling theoreticians. In this final volume in a series on contemporary art (e.g., The New York School, LJ 9/1/78), Sandler covers everything from specific defined movements to changes in markets. New Image Painting, Bad Art, Deconstruction Art, Commodity Art, Neo-Geo, and even so-called "pathetic art" are called on, as well as the better-known Feminist Art, Pattern Painting, and so on. This major survey is lucid, sympathetic, exhaustive, and generally objective, whether speaking of political correctness, money and fashion, or explicit sexual taboos as art. Endnotes are lengthy and important.

The publication of his satirical lithographs in Belgian magazines paved the way for his great breakthrough and his frontispice for Baudelaire&#39;s Espaves added the final touch to his burgeoning fame. Rops was a brilliant observer who painted atmospheric seascapes and landscapes. However, it was his ironic, caricatured and sometimes risqu, drawings, lithographs and engravings that were especially popular. Now, a hundred years since the artist&#39;s death, his work has lost none of its playfulness or eloquence.

Over more than four decades, he built a reputation writing reviews for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and, later, arguing onscreen with rival <i>Chicago Tribune</i> critic Gene Siskel and later Richard Roeper about the movies they loved and loathed. But Ebert went well beyond a mere &#x201c;thumbs up&#x201d; or &#x201c;thumbs down.&#x201d; Readers could always sense the man behind the words, a man with interests beyond film and a lifetime&#x2019;s distilled wisdom about the larger world. Although the world lost one of its most important critics far too early, Ebert lives on in the minds of moviegoers today, who continually find themselves debating what he might have thought about a current movie.<br><br><i>The Great Movies IV</i> is the fourth&#x2014;and final&#x2014;collection of Roger Ebert&#x2019;s essays, comprising sixty-two reviews of films ranging from the silent era to the recent past. From films like <i>The Cabinet of Caligari </i>and <i>Viridiana </i>that have been considered canonical for decades to movies only recently recognized as masterpieces to <i>Superman, The Big Lebowski,</i> and <i>Pink Floyd: The Wall,</i> the pieces gathered here demonstrate the critical acumen seen in Ebert&#x2019;s daily reviews and the more reflective and wide-ranging considerations that the longer format allowed him to offer. Ebert&#x2019;s essays are joined here by an insightful foreword by film critic Matt Zoller Seitz, the current editor-in-chief of the official Roger Ebert website, and a touching introduction by Chaz Ebert.<br><br> A fitting capstone to a truly remarkable career, <i>The Great Movies IV </i>will introduce newcomers to some of the most exceptional movies ever made, while revealing new insights to connoisseurs as well.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Roger Ebert</b> (1942&#x2013;2013) was a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning film critic for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>.

The Sixth Edition of Starr and McMillan&#39;s best-selling HUMAN BIOLOGY is designed to help students understand human biology by engaging them in learning in every way possible. Segments on the FREE accompanying interactive CD-ROM, as well as the CNN Today videos, Web links, and reading from the InfoTrac College Edition library are all integrated with the text to support, illuminate, and reinforce the text. The chapter opening &#34;Impacts, Issues&#34; case study focuses students on a key biology-related societal issue and is revisited throughout the chapter. Then the chapter&#39;s &#34;How Would You Vote?&#34; feature asks students to consider a related news topics, gather and evaluate pro/con information, apply knowledge, and cast a vote on the Web. Students can see how peers in their state and across the nation voted. The free Student CD-ROM provides access to BiologyNow, a powerful diagnostic learning tool that helps students assess their unique study needs through pretests and personalized learning plans. The content has been updated as well. Several key chapters have been reorganized to improve the flow of ideas and to better tie core concepts to illustrations. For example, the chapter on digestion and nutrition has expanded coverage of dietary guidelines and weight control. Chapter 9 provides a more focused, better-illustrated discussion of heart structure, the cardiac cycle, and circuits of blood flow. Coverage of human evolution is expanded in Chapter 24. Other updated content can be found in the chapters on the muscular system, digestive system, and cardiovascular system. There is also expanded coverage of topics such as food allergies, newly emerging infectious diseases including SARS, &#34;Mad Cow&#34; disease, and West Nile virus. Sections on disorders of the nervous system and immune system have been expanded too</p><p>For the past two decades, Cecie Starr has been known as one of the best-selling biology textbook authors.

The authors&#x2019; approach reflects a balanced focus on people, their environment, and the ways in which people interact with their environment. Essential techniques including how to conduct initial interviews with clients, crisis intervention, arriving at assessments, and choosing appropriate treatment, are thoroughly explained, and often clarified with case studies and vignettes, preparing readers to assess social work clients from a variety of perspectives. The book is designed for the graduate-level student who needs to master the principles, theories, and approaches of the psychosocial approach to applied practice, but it may also be used to fit a variety of courses, including the Introduction to Social Work BSW student who is looking for supplemental information on the basics of clinical practice. Now in its fifth edition, <i><b>Casework</b></i> has been thoroughly revised to keep discussions clear and up to date. New material has been added throughout, including a greater variety of case studies, discussions about current topics such as the influence of ethnicity and diversity in the social work practice, changes in family life roles, changes in ideas and practice approaches, and a significantly updated bibliography for reference.</p><p>Mary E.

In a few short years, he made astounding discoveries in physics, astronomy, optics, and mathematics&#x2014; yet never told a soul. Though isolated, snobbish, and jealous, he almost single-handedly changed the course of scientific advancement and ushered in the Enlightenment. Newton invented the refracting telescope, explained the motion of planets and comets, discovered the multicolored nature of light, and created an entirely new field of mathematical understanding: calculus. The world might have been a very different place had Netwon&#x2019;s theories and observations not been coaxed out of him by his colleagues. &nbsp;<i>Isaac Newton and Physics for Kids </i>paints a rich portrait of this brilliant and complex man, including 21 hands-on projects that explore the scientific concepts Newton developed and the times in which he lived. Readers will build a simple waterwheel, create a 17thcentury plague mask, track the phases of the moon, and test Newton&#x2019;s Three Laws of Motion using coins, a skateboard, and a model boat they construct themselves. The text includes a time line, online resources, and reading list for further study. And through it all, readers will learn how the son of a Woolsthorpe sheep farmer grew to become the most influential physicist in history.</p><p><strong>Kerrie Logan Hollihan has written for&nbsp;<i>Boy&#x2019;s Life</i> magazine.</strong>Grade 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;An opening time line commences with the 1642 marriage of Newton's parents and closes with his death in 1727, and a general introduction describes the man and the times in which he lived. The text touches on Newton's childhood in Woolsthorpe, his studies at Cambridge, which led to his three laws of motion, and his time as master of the Royal Mint and president of the Royal Society. The activities elucidate, for example, concepts in mathematics ("What Are the Odds?") and physics ("Create Optical Illusions"), and reveal more historical details. For example, in a section on the 17th-century plague, readers are provided with instructions on how to make a mask like those worn by doctors of the time. The activities will generally not be suitable for science fairs, but are likely to engage readers. Lengthy sidebars provide additional information about pertinent subjects ("Comets," "Churches, Kings, and Freedom of Speech") as well as individuals and events that influenced Newton's work. The writing is clear and detailed, but is best suited for motivated readers. Black-and-white illustrations on every spread consist primarily of reproductions of art and of scientific diagrams. Some of the further-reading suggestions, including two tiles by Newton, are for adults. This will be a handy supplement to a physics curriculum and would be a useful selection for school and public libraries.&#x2014;<i>Maren Ostergard, King County Library System, Issaquah, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many years in the making, the book has been co-authored by a team of conservation scientists who have carried out pathbreaking technical analyses. The EreEsult is an entirely fresh and up-to-date account of the history of sculpture in Thailand.</p><p>ARTSCUThis book can be read as a straightforward catalog of the extensive collection of Buddha figures in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, where Woodward is curator of Asian art. In another sense it is the tale of a sensitive young Baltimore banker, who was seduced by Thailand in 1945 and went on to assemble a far-reaching group of bronze and stone images for their aesthetic appeal. This catalog also attempts to give a solid scientific basis to the categorization of Thai sculpture into its various eras and regions?a process previously based on the more subjective grounds of stylistic analysis. In addition to the fine illustrations and the extensive technical data, seven chapters provide a chronological discussion of the development of Thai sculpture between the Dvaravati kingdom of the seventh century and the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767. In all, this is the single most important work on the sculpture of Thailand published to date.

The general public is largely unaware of just how many castles survive today or over how wide an area of Europe and the Middle East they are to be found.Fortifications specialist J.E. and H.W. Kaufmann and technical artist Robert Jurga (authors of the acclaimed <i>Fortress Europe: European Fortifications of World War II</i> ) have once again combined European sources and personal observations to present a unique portrait of military architecture. They reveal how the medieval fortress combined both Roman and barbarian features, with some influences from as far away as China. Detailed coverage is given for castles in the British Isles, France, Germany, Moorish Spain, and as far east as Poland and Russia, as well as Muslim and Crusader castles in the Middle East. <i>The Medieval Fortress</i> covers the origin and evolution of the castles and other walled defenses, their major components, and the reasons for their eventual decline, which was not solely due to the introduction of gunpowder. Also receiving extensive coverage are the weapons and equipment of garrisons and besieging troops. Over a hundred photographs and 150 extraordinarily detailed technical drawings accompany the main text, which also takes an in-depth look at representative castles of each major type.</p><p>J.E. Kaufmann and H.W. Kaufmann (San Antonio, TX) are acknowledged experts in the field of fortifications and have written extensively in the field. Robert M. Jurga is a well-renowned Polish illustrator who has contributed art work for numerous books and magazines.<b>J.E. Kaufmann</b> is the author of six books on fortifications. He and his wife, H.W.

Children's librarians are busier than ever before. Bookstores featuring children's books are flourishing. The authors and illustrators who create exquisite children's books are popular. Although the profusion of books and the widespread interest in children's literature are welcome, they create an even greater need to educate parents, teachers, and librarians about books and literary experiences. Because the dull, the difficult, the obscure can stymie children's pleasure in literature, adults must optimize children's interactions with literature. Moreover, the subjects and the textbooks used in elementary classrooms cry out for the richness of literature. </p><p> This book is the product of many experiences as teachers, professors, parents, and grandparents. Our goal is to help adults infuse literature into children's lives very early and to promote a continuing interest in books throughout their lives. Our theme is literature for a lifetime. We hope to prepare the adults in children's lives to:</p><p>know which books children will respond to share literature with children in authentic ways that stimulate their responses infuse literature into elementary classrooms and homes identify books that portray children with special needs so their classmates will understand these needs use computer programs and the Internet to enhance literary experiences use multimedia in creating literary experience choose literature that will develop children's cultural consciousness </p><p> Chapters 1 through 5 develop a basis for understanding children's literature, including evaluating and selecting literature and encouraging children's response. Chapters 6 through 11 explore the content of children's literature in picture books, poetry, traditional literature, modern fantasy, realistic fiction, historical fiction, and nonfiction. We have continued our emphasis on authors and illustrators in this edition by including profiles of them throughout the book. In these profiles, we hope to acquaint students with authors and illustrators and their works, as well as offer models for classroom study. Chapters 12 through 15 prepare adults to nurture children's response to literature by showing how creating a community of readers as well as providing oral and silent reading experiences enhance literary experiences. Moreover, adults need to select literature that develops students' sensitivity to other cultures as well as the life challenges faced by people in our world. Finally, Chapter 15 synthesizes and presents sample guides and units that teachers have used in developing literature-based classroom experiences. </p><p> Each chapter opens with a list of key terms, guiding questions, and an overview that previews the content of the chapter. Vignettes are included in each chapter, which give examples of teachers and children involved with literature#151;examples that will serve as models for others. Throughout the book experiences are presented that develop deeper cognitive and affective understandings as well as aesthetic awareness. </p><p> Each chapter includes thought questions and research and application experiences. Annotated bibliographies of cited books and recommended books include genre identifications and suggested grade levels. Where appropriate, asterisks (*) indicate books that will appeal to reluctant readers. NEW TO THIS EDITION </p><p> Users of the first edition of Children's Literature: Discovery for a Lifetime will find several important changes in the second edition.</p><p>All bibliographies and references have been thoroughly updated to reflect the latest children's books. Author and illustrator profiles have been placed throughout the text. Historical fiction and realistic fiction are now treated in two separate chapters, giving greater attention to each genre. A new chapter, "Culturally Conscious Literature," explores multicultural and international children's literature while focusing on broad-based units of study that transcend individual cultures. Books that are especially appropriate for struggling readers are indicated in the bibliographies. SUPPLEMENTS </p><p> Supporting this second edition are three supplements that we hope you and your students will find valuable.</p><p>The updated Instructor's Manual contains chapter outlines, teaching tips, suggested test items, and model syllabi. Instructors may contact their local Merrill/Prentice Hall representatives to obtain this supplement. Extensive bibliographies have been placed on a dual-platform, searchable CD database packaged free with every copy. Instructors and students can easily use this software to search for children's books by author, title, illustrator, genre, subject, reading, interest level, publisher, copyright year, and combinations thereof. Furthermore, readers can save comments on existing entries and enter bibliographic information for other titles of their choosing. This software will be an indispensable professional resource for years to come. A free Companion Website allows on-line posting of syllabi and has an interactive study guide, links to web-based resources, a message board, and numerous other features. Instructors and students may access the Companion Website at prenhall/stoodt-hill </p><p> We hope that our enthusiasm will stimulate you to read to children, talk about books with them, and acquaint them with the joy of literature that will last them a lifetime. </p><p> We wish to express our sincere appreciation for the support and encouragement of Brad Potthoff and Mary Evangelista. </p><p> We would also like to thank the following reviewers: Susan Knell, Pittsburgh State University; Barbara N.

Achebe&#x2019;s most famous novel introduces us to Okonkwo, an important member of the Igbo people, who fails to adjust as his village is colonized by the British. In <i>No Longer at Ease </i>we meet his grandson, Obi Okonkwo, a young man who was sent to a university in England and has returned, only to clash with the ruling elite to which he now believes he belongs. <i>Arrow of God </i>tells the story of Ezuelu, the chief priest of several Nigerian villages, and his battle with Christian missionaries.<br><br>In these masterful novels, Achebe brilliantly sets universal tales of personal and moral struggle in the context of the tragic drama of colonization.</p><p><b>Chinua Achebe </b>was born in Nigeria in 1930. His first<b> </b>novel, <i>Things Falls Apart</i>, became a classic of international literature and required reading for students worldwide. He also authored four subsequent novels, two short-story collections, and numerous other books. He was the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University and, for over 15 years, was the Charles P. Stevenson Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College. In 2007, Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement. He died in 2013. <br><br><b>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie </b>grew up in Nigeria. A 2003 O. Henry Prize winner, Adichie now divides her time between the United States and Nigeria.I N T R O D U C T I O N<br>BY CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE<br><br>&#x2014;&#x2014;<br><br>When, in 1958, the London publishers William Heinemann received a manuscript of Chinua Achebe&#x2019;s <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, they were unsure whether to publish it. The central question, according to editor Alan Hill, was this: &#x2018;Would anyone possibly buy a novel by an African?&#x2019; Not only were there a mere handful of examples of African writing in English at the time &#x2013; such as Amos Tutuola&#x2019;s surreal The Palm-Wine Drinkard and Cyprian Ekwensi&#x2019;s novel of contemporary Lagos, People of the City &#x2013; but none of them had the ambition, the subtlety, or the confidence of Things Fall Apart.<br><br>Chinua Achebe had initially conceived it as a story of three generations: a man in pre-colonial Igboland who struggles against the changes brought by the first European missionaries and administrators; his son who converts to Christianity and receives some Western education; and his grandson who is educated in England and is living the life of the new elite on the cusp of independence. Achebe later scaled down the novel, focusing only on the first generation, to produce a carefully observed story of the African European colonial encounter set among the Igbo people of south-eastern Nigeria in the 1890s, with the tragic hero Okonkwo at its center. Achebe&#x2019;s second novel, No Longer at Ease, would skip a generation and tell the story of Okonkwo&#x2019;s grandson, Obi, a civil servant in 1950s Lagos. His third novel, Arrow of God, about an Igbo priest and a British district officer in 1920s Igboland, can be read as representative of the times of Okonkwo&#x2019;s son. All three novels, taken together as Achebe&#x2019;s &#x2018;African Trilogy&#x2019;, create a full and beautifully nuanced arc, a human chronicle of the cultural and political changes that brought about what is now seen as the modern African state.<br><br>After William Heinemann overcame their reservations and published <i>Things Fall Apart</i> in June 1958, it became a critical success. Achebe, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> wrote, had &#x2018;genuinely succeeded in presenting tribal life from the inside.&#x2019; A novelty indeed. Things Fall Apart was pioneering not in its subject but in its African point of view, as there were already many well-regarded books about Africans written by non-Africans; tribal life had already been endlessly portrayed from the outside. Achebe himself first read some of the better-known examples of these &#x2018;colonialism classics&#x2019; as a secondary-school student in the 1940s. &#x2018;I did not see myself as an African to begin with,&#x2019; he has written about his response to the African characters. &#x2018;I took sides with the white men against the savages. The white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and courageous. The savages arrayed against him were sinister and stupid or, at the most, cunning. I hated their guts.&#x2019; As Achebe matured and became more critical in his reading, he began to understand the enormous power that stories had, and how much this power was shaped by who told the stories and by how they were told. As a university student in the 1950s, in addition to reading Wordsworth, Shakespeare and Coleridge, Achebe also read Joyce Cary&#x2019;s Mister Johnson, a novel set in Nigeria, which Time magazine had named the &#x2018;best book ever written about Africa.&#x2019; Achebe disagreed. Not only was the Nigerian character in the novel unrecognizable to him and his classmates but he also detected, in the description of Nigerians, &#x2018;an undertow of uncharitableness . . . a contagion of distaste, hatred and mockery.&#x2019;<br><br>There has been much written about Chinua Achebe&#x2019;s <i>Things Fall Apart</i> as a response to Mister Johnson, and one likes to think that Achebe would have written his novel even if he had not read Cary&#x2019;s. Still, the prejudiced representation of African characters in literature could not but have had an influence on Achebe&#x2019;s development as a writer. He would, years later, write a famous essay about the portrayal of Africans in Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s classic novel <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, arguing that while Conrad had written honestly about the racism of the time, he had failed to hold an authorial rejection of that world-view. The strangeness of seeing oneself distorted in literature &#x2013; and indeed of not seeing oneself at all &#x2013; was part of my own childhood. I grew up in the Nigerian university town of Nsukka in the 1980s, reading a lot of British children&#x2019;s books. My early writing mimicked the books I was reading: all my characters were white and all my stories were set in England. Then I read <i>Things Fall Apart</i>. It was a glorious shock of discovery, as was <i>Arrow of God</i>, which I read shortly afterwards; I did not know in a concrete way until then that people like me could exist in literature. Here was a book that was unapologetically African, that was achingly familiar, but that was, also, exotic because it detailed the life of my people a hundred years before. Because I was educated in a Nigerian system that taught me little of my pre-colonial past, because I could not, for example, imagine with any accuracy how life had been organized in my part of the world in 1890, Achebe&#x2019;s novels became strangely personal. <i>Things Fall Apart</i> was no longer a novel about a man whose exaggerated masculinity and encompassing fear of weakness make it impossible for him to adapt to the changes in his society, it became the life my great-grandfather might have lived. <i>Arrow of God</i> was no longer just about the British administration&#x2019;s creation of warrant chiefs, and the linked destinies of two men &#x2013; one an Igbo priest, the other a British administrator; it became the story of my ancestral hometown during my grandfather&#x2019;s time. And <i>No Longer at Ease</i> transcended the story of an educated young Nigerian struggling with the pressure of new urban expectations in Lagos, and became the story of my father&#x2019;s generation.</p><h2>Modern Control Systems</h2><p>Written to be equally useful for all engineering disciplines, this book is organized around the concept of control systems theory as it has been developed in the frequency and time domains.

Bernard Williams's original and radical book questions this picture of Western history. While we are in many ways different from the Greeks, Williams claims that the differences are not to be traced to a shift in these basic conceptions of ethical life. We are more like the ancients than we are prepared to acknowledge, and only when this is understood can we properly grasp our most important differences from them, such as our rejection of slavery.<br><br>The author is a philosopher, but much of his book is directed to writers such as Homer and the tragedians, whom he discusses as poets and not just as materials for philosophy. At the center of his study is the question of how we can understand Greek tragedy at all, when its world is so far from ours.<br><br>Williams explains how it is that when the ancients speak, they do not merely tell us about themselves, but about ourselves. In a new foreword A.A. Long explores the impact of this volume in the context of Williams's stunning career.</p><p><b>Bernard Williams </b>(1929-2003) was one of the most distinguished British philosophers of the twentieth century, White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford University, and Monroe Deutsch Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley."A dazzlingly clever and agile assault. . . . Williams's treatment of shame is brilliant. . . . Mr Williams's mind is subtle, his reasoning complex. In places this is a difficult book, but always because the argument requires it; essentially, it is a model of philosophical lucidity. And though it is deeply serious, we can often catch an ironic inflection in the author's voice." -- <i>Richard Jenkyns, New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Brilliant, demanding, disturbing." -- <i>Bernard Knox, The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"Clearly written, well argued, and carefully documented." -- <i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"Poets often prove to be much better observers of human thought, character and action than philosophers, historians or psychologists, who are apt to launch into theory and generalisation before they have a good description of what they are setting out to explain. This is what Williams's discussions of the ancient texts bring out in every instance, and what makes his book worth reading, not just for those who are interested in the question whether we have made any real moral progress, but also for those who are interested in the Greeks, or in the varieties of ethical experience." -- <i>Gisela Striker, London Review of Books</i></p><h2>God&#39;s Prophetic Symbolism in Everyday Life: The Divinity Code to Hearing God?s Voice Through Natural Events and Divine Occurrences</h2><p><p><b>Decode the Prophetic Language of God!</b></p> <p>In <i>The Divinity Code to Understanding Your Dreams and Visions,</i> Adam Thompson and Adrian Beale taught you the supernatural keys to interpreting God's voice through your dreams.</p> <p>In this follow-up work, Thompson and Beale offer revelatory insights about the prophetic language that God speaks through everyday signs, symbols and pictures!</p> <p><i>God's Prophetic Symbolism in Everyday Life</i> will open your eyes to how God is constantly speaking to you through what's around you.</p> <p>Learn how to:</p> <ol> <li>� Tune your prophetic senses to hear the ever-speaking voice of the Holy Spirit.</li> <li>� Open your spiritual eyes to discern what God is saying to you through everyday occurrences.</li> <li>� Discern the supernatural meaning of unusual coincidences.</li> <li>� Operate in the prophetic and seer anointings.</li> </ol> <p><b>Open your eyes and ears to the prophetic language of the Holy Spirit!</b></p></p><p><p>Adam has a remarkable grace to interpret dreams, release words of knowledge and operate in the prophetic.

Collier&#x2019;s portraits of the porters at work alternate with bold, sweeping spreads of cotton fields, onto which a porter scatters discarded books and magazines, planting knowledge along the railway lines. The story travels from South to North and from old to new, ending in Harlem, where a contemporary African-American mother rides in a subway car, her son gazing out the window. In the next spread, he&#x2019;s seen in startling closeup, parting and peering between the stripes of an all-but-invisible American flag. &#x201c;I, too, am America,&#x201d; he says.

Their father&#x2019;s cold obsession with the future of his business empire, the malevolent plotting of his greedy manager, Mr. Carker, and the tragic self-contempt of his proud second wife, Edith, cast a dark shadow over the life of the motherless girl. But as the world of Dombey and Son begins to fall to pieces, Florence is sustained by the warmth and brightness of humbler allies: her fiercely loyal nurse, Susan Nipper; her haplessly devoted suitor, Toots; the rough but loveable old salt Captain Cuttle and his friend Sol Gills; and her fervent admirer, the orphan Walter Gay. In its locomotive power and its transcendent moments of suspense and revelation, <i>Dombey and Son</i> is a superb example of Dickens&#x2019;s ability to combine the qualities of a social historian, a theatrical artist, and a poet of the utmost tenderness and insight.<br><br>Charles Dickens set this tale of a hard-hearted businessman, the son he pins all his hopes on, and the daughter he cruelly neglects in a country undergoing the storms of change brought by the Industrial Revolution.<br><br>This edition reprints the original Everyman&#x2019;s introduction by G.K.

By attracting impressive support from citizens, whose activism takes the form of protests, boycotts, civil disobedience, and other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, these efforts help separate regimes from their main sources of power and produce remarkable results, even in Iran, Burma, the Philippines, and the Palestinian Territories.<br><br>Combining statistical analysis with case studies of specific countries and territories, Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan detail the factors enabling such campaigns to succeed and, sometimes, causing them to fail. They find that nonviolent resistance presents fewer obstacles to moral and physical involvement and commitment, and that higher levels of participation contribute to enhanced resilience, greater opportunities for tactical innovation and civic disruption (and therefore less incentive for a regime to maintain its status quo), and shifts in loyalty among opponents' erstwhile supporters, including members of the military establishment. <br><br>Chenoweth and Stephan conclude that successful nonviolent resistance ushers in more durable and internally peaceful democracies, which are less likely to regress into civil war. Presenting a rich, evidentiary argument, they originally and systematically compare violent and nonviolent outcomes in different historical periods and geographical contexts, debunking the myth that violence occurs because of structural and environmental factors and that it is necessary to achieve certain political goals. Instead, the authors discover, violent insurgency is rarely justifiable on strategic grounds.</p><p>Combining statistical analysis with case studies of specific countries and territories, Erica Chenoweth and Maria J.

At a time when industrial methods were being introduced into farming, Steiner had a radically different, evolutionary vision. Based on a revitalized relationship with nature, his approach encompassed knowledge of the cosmos, the elemental world and the Earth, and utilized special planting methods and preparations. Today biodynamic agriculture is widely valued and used around the world. <br><br> In addition to the lively and entertaining accounts of the agriculture course held at Koberwitz, this extraordinary book features Countess Keyserlingk&#x2019;s memories of her meetings with Rudolf Steiner, who told the Countess her form of consciousness would be usual &#x201c;in the third millennium.&#x201d; Her reminiscences reflect this uncommon quality. Also included are essays by the editor that incorporate rare material, including communications received by Countess Keyserlingk after Steiner&#x2019;s death. <br><br> This book will be of interest to students of biodynamics as well as those interested in how Rudolf Steiner worked to develop Anthroposophy.

In an effort to extirpate the Cathar heresy, Pope Innocent III launched what is now known as the Albigensian Crusade, but it was fiercely resisted by the lords and people of the Languedoc, if in the end in vain. This &#x2019;song&#x2019; was written in two parts, the first by William of Tudela, a supporter of the crusade; the second by an anonymous continuer, wholeheartedly in sympathy with the southerners, although not with the heretics themselves. It stands as a historical source of great importance, not least because it depicts the side that lost. The poem is also a skilful, dramatic and often impassioned composition, evoking the brilliant world of landed knights and the glories and bloody realities of battle. Janet Shirley is an award-winning translator of works on the French Middle Ages. Other publications by her include the Song of Roland and, in this Crusade Texts in Translation series, Crusader Syria in the 13th Century and, with Peter Edbury, Guillaume de Machaut: The Conquest of Alexandria.</p><p>Janet Shirley is a distinguished translator of works on the Crusades and the French Middle Ages. Her previous translations include the Song of Roland and The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem by Professor Jean Richard.&#39;... this is quite simply one of the best sources of medieval warfare one could hope for ... the all-important fact that it is the first available [rendering] in English (and faithfully translated by Janet Shirley) will ensure its great utility ... It is highly recommended.&#39; The Catholic Historical Review &#39;Shirley&#39;s translation is thoroughly clear...

In accordance with this plan it lays down three rules for the use of the comma, instead of a score or more, and one for the use of the semicolon, in the belief that these four rules provide for all the internal punctuation that is required by nineteen sentences out of twenty. Similarly, it gives in Chapter III only those principles of the paragraph and the sentence which are of the widest application. The book thus covers only a small portion of the field of English style. The experience of its writer has been that once past the essentials, students profit most by individual instruction based on the problems of their own work, and that each instructor has his own body of theory, which he may prefer to that offered by any textbook. The Elements of Style is a prescriptive American English writing style guide in numerous editions. The original was composed by William Strunk Jr., in 1918, and published by Harcourt, in 1920, comprising eight "elementary rules of usage", ten "elementary principles of composition", "a few matters of form", a list of 49 "words and expressions commonly misused", and a list of 57 "words often misspelled". E. B. White greatly enlarged and revised the book for publication by Macmillan in 1959. That was the first edition of the so-called "Strunk &amp; White", which Time named in 2011 one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.</p><p>William Strunk and E. B. White</p><h2>Soul on Bikes</h2><p>When Sonny Barger formed the Oakland Hell&#39;s Angels in 1957, a few miles up East 14th Street in East Oakland, a young black bike rider form Louisiana named Tobie Gene Levingston was soon to follow in Barger&#39;s footsteps. The two knew and respected each other and had ridden their Harleys together in the same East Bay neighborhood. In 1959, Tobie Gene organized the Dragons, a loosely knit, all-black men&#39;s club, one of the first of its kind. The dragon&#39;s earliest incarnation began as an all-black car club. It originally stemmed from Tobie Gene&#39;s big brother role to keep his younger brothers and friends occupied and out of trouble. The Dragons became ten strong, including members like MacArthur, Hooker, Tobie&#39;s brothers Joe Louis and Jonas, Baby Joe, Sam and Cousin Rabbit. Tobie Gene became the East Bay Dragons MC&#39;s first and only president, still reigning and riding after forty-four years.&#39;</p><p>The East Bay Dragons Motorcycle Club has gunned its Harleys through the meanest streets of Oakland, Calif., since the 1950s. While Rosa Parks took her historic bus ride, before Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X and Huey P. Newton and the Black Panthers stood bravely for equal rights, the East Bay Dragons MC risked life and limb during the days when it was a revolutionary act for a black man to ride a Harley chopper. <p> Here's a slice of underground American and African-American history you're unlikely to read in any history book. Tobie Gene Levingston and his colorful cast of misfits and comrades are an all-black, all-Harley, all-chopper group of motorcyclists who have found more than their fair share of violence and redemption on the battlegrounds of urban America. </p><p> Headquartered in Oakland, California, the East Bay Dragons exist alongside the Hell's Angels and the Oakland Raiders, securing their place as modern urban folk heroes. Starting out in the 1950s as a car club, Tobie Gene and the Dragons switched to two wheels and encountered street scuffles, rival clubs, ethnic stereotypes, police misconduct, and racial tensions. Their legacy is an untold portion of African-American history. From his humble beginnings as the son of a poor sharecropper, Tobie Gene became the founder and president of the nation's most elite exclusively black motorcycle club. Soul on Bikes recounts the club's adventures with humor, attitude, and most important, soul.</p>In <i>Soul on Bikes</i>, East Bay Dragons Motorcycle Club founder Tobie Gene Levington&#x2019;s personal journey transforms him from a southern sharecropper&#x2019;s son into a street leader riding a chopped Harley through the acid-laced days of Haight-Ashbury and Monterey Pop. In the tumultuous 1960s Levingston and the East Bay Dragons exploded onto Oakland streets alongside the Black Panther Party. Levingston and the Dragons survived the cocaine-fueled 1980s and rode their Harleys to glory into the new millennium.&nbsp;Filled with wisdom, joy, sadness, anger, and redemption, <i>Soul on Bikes</i> is the previously untold tale of an underground African-American culture, a hell-raising history of an all-black motorcycle club that defied the odds by surviving its wild 40-plus-years-long ride.&nbsp;Co-authors Keith and Kent Zimmerman are a unique writing team of twin brothers. They collaborated with Ralph &#x201c;Sonny&#x201d; Barger on <i>Hell&#x2019;s Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell&#x2019;s Angels Motorcycle Club</i>. They also co-authored <i>Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs</i>, the autobiography of John &#x201c;Johnny Rotten&#x201d; Lydon of the Sex Pistols.<br></p><h2>Practical Meta-Analysis (Applied Social Research Methods)</h2><p><p>What research designs and methodological features qualify a study for meta-analysis and which disqualify it? What types of research reports are appropriate for the meta-analysis? What is the cultural and linguistic range of the studies to be included? By integrating and translating the current methodological and statistical work into a practical guide, the authors address these questions to provide readers with a state-of-the-art introduction to the various approaches to doing meta-analysis. </p></p><p><p>Mark W.

Coverage is international, tracing the spread of science from its traditional centers and explaining how the prevailing knowledge of non-Western societies has modified or contributed to the dominant global science as it is currently understood. Revealing the interplay between science and the wider culture, the <em>Companion</em> includes entries on topics such as minority groups, art, religion, and science's practical applications. One hundred biographies of the most iconic historic figures, chosen for their contributions to science and the interest of their lives, are also included. Above all <em>The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science</em> is a companion to world history: modern in coverage, generous in breadth, and cosmopolitan in scope. <br> The volume's utility is enhanced by a thematic outline of the entire contents, a thorough system of cross-referencing, and a detailed index that enables the reader to follow a specific line of inquiry along various threads from multiple starting points. Each essay has numerous suggestions for further reading, all of which favor literature that is accessible to the general reader, and a bibliographical essay provides a general overview of the scholarship in the field. Lastly, as a contribution to the visual appeal of the <em>Companion,</em> over 100 black-and-white illustrations and an eight-page color section capture the eye and spark the imagination.<br></p><p>John L. Heilbron is a Professor Emeritus of the History of Science, University of California at Berkeley.This is not a science encyclopedia but, as the title states, a companion guide to the history of science. The time covered is from the Renaissance (about 1550) to the beginning of the twenty-first century. It is similar to other Oxford Companions, such as <i>The Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine</i> (2001). The editor is widely published in the history of science, and he worked with a distinguished editorial board, along with 217 international contributors. The intended audience is scientifically curious adult readers. The volume is appropriate for undergraduate science majors. <p>The 609 entries cover scientific disciplines, historical developments in science, people, institutions, and other topics. Examples include <i>Astrolabe, Astrophysics, Botanical garden, Hypothesis, Nazi science, Navigation, Oxygen</i>, and<i> Scientific Revolution.</i> About 100 of the entries are biographical. Entries are signed and accompanied by solid bibliographies. Most of the recommended readings are books, but Web sites and journals are also included. There are four pages of color plates, and black-and-white photos and illustrations are interspersed in the text. Cross-references, a list of entries by broad topic, and an index (not always found in Oxford Companion titles) facilitate access. </p><p>This volume makes a good supplement to an encyclopedia of scientific history, such as Scribner's <i>History of Modern Science and Mathematics</i> [RBB D 1 02].

For two generations conservative Christians have rejected the idea of a permissive "hands off" discipline and adopted a strict "hands on" discipline taught by many well-known Christian parenting authorities. In <i>Heartfelt Discipline</i>, Clay Clarkson advocates a different biblical model--a relational "hands around" discipline. If you have young children and are beginning to try to solve the discipline puzzle for your family, start with this book. It is a fresh, formula-free, and fully biblical perspective on childhood discipline that will change the way you think about your children. You'll see how all the biblical pieces fit together and make sense, and put you on the path to your child's heart.<br><br>From the Back Cover:<br><br><b>Childhood discipline is your responsibility.</b><br><br>As a Christian parent, you know your children need you to &#x201c;bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.&#x201d; The Bible is clear about <i>what</i> you should do. But what about <i>how</i> you should do it? The way you answer will shape how your children remember your parenting and family.<br><br><i>Heartfelt Discipline</i> contends there is no divine &#x201c;how to&#x201d; formula for childhood discipline. Rather, there is a &#x201c;way.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the way of life, the path we walk with God. It&#x2019;s about faith, grace, freedom, and heart, expressed in three principles of discipline as you walk the path with your children:<br><br><b>Direction:</b> Guiding and showing them how to walk on the path with God<br><b>Correction</b> Getting them back on the path when sin leads them off of it<br><b>Protection:</b> Guarding them from temptations that could draw them away<br><br>In <i>Heartfelt Discipline</i> Clay Clarkson helps you understand what the Bible really says about childhood discipline. Drawing on thirty years of parenting and his personal study of the Bible, Clay fully fleshes out God&#x2019;s way of &#x201c;path of life parenting.&#x201d; It will change how you think about childhood discipline, and put you on the path of life to your child&#x2019;s heart.</p><p><b>Clay Clarkson</b> is the father of four wholehearted children, all grown and following God on their own paths of life.

Rawlings left a significant body of work, including 200 Vogue covers, of which Yohannan is the curator. Rawlings was a fashion photographer determined to show more than clothes, which for him were simply one of several elements in an environment where the model dwelt for a camera instant. What resulted from his approach were fully developed works of art that beg for analysis; each image has the quality of a starting point for a tale. In selecting photographs that defy time, Yohannan has built a volume that is both a tribute to an artist and an insight into how genius can endure in a world that is often thought of as "commercial."

The playful and colorful monsters are designed to give children (and even older audiences) an intuitive understanding of the building blocks of numbers and the basics of multiplication. The introduction and appendices can also help adult readers answer questions about factoring from their young audience. The artwork is crisp and creative and the colors are bright and engaging, making this volume a welcome deviation from standard math texts.<p> CRC Press Author and NPR's <em>Math Guy</em> Keith Devlin spoke with Scott Simon about how the book makes finding prime numbers fun.</p><p> "This is one of the most amazing math books for kids I have ever seen...," Devlin says. "Great colors, it's wonderful, and yet because [Schwartz] knows the mathematics, he very skillfully and subtly embeds mathematical ideas into the drawings."</p></p><p><p>Richard Schwartz grew up in Los Angeles.

Apart from an introduction and some explanatory material in the back, it consists of one hundred double pages: on the left page is a number and that many dots, arranged into clusters that display its factorization. On the right page is a picture that represents the same information using the author's 'monsters,' which represent the prime numbers. --MAA<br>This compact, innovative book counts to 100 using prime numbers represented as monsters, each with identifying characteristics (two resembles a bee with two buggy eyes, and three is an angry-looking triangular creature). The book opens with explanations of multiplication, prime and composite numbers, and factor trees, then moves on to a list of numbers. Each prime number looks unique, while composite numbers are represented by scenes involving their prime monsters (eight is illustrated as three of the beelike twos, i.e., two times two times two. Readers may have difficulty deciphering the pictures, which come to resemble little works of abstract geometric art. But especially for creative learners, visualizing the roles each monster plays may lead to deeper number sense. Ages 4 to 8. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>My eight-year old granddaughter Natalie is just learning about multiplication and as we read through almost the whole book, she especially liked the 'special numbers' (primes) where a new shape appeared. At one point she paused and said, 'You never get two special numbers one right after the other.' I gave positive reinforcement for this, her first mathematical conjecture (not mentioning the one counterexample of 2 and 3). She's going to take the book to her second grade class.

His captivating photographs serve as a visual record of the dramatic evolution of this exciting and diverse metropolis.&nbsp;</p>Shulman&#x2019;s best-known images consist of mid-century views of Modernist domestic interiors, notably the iconic Case Study House #22 of 1960, in which two well-dressed women sit inside the floor-to-ceiling window walls of a Pierre Koenig&#x2013;designed house that seems to float like a spaceship over the light-spangled urban sprawl beyond. Not as well known but equally powerful are Shulman&#x2019;s images of Union Station and downtown&#x2019;s vintage office buildings, the dynamic Wilshire Boulevard corridor, the region&#x2019;s eclectic coffee shops and movie theaters, the sweeping canopy of the Century Plaza Hotel, the diverse fabric of L.A.&#x2019;s residential neighborhoods, and the panoramic vistas of the city of the future under construction.&nbsp;The author selected sixty images from the Getty Research Institute&#x2019;s Shulman archive for this elegant book, for which he also wrote an informative essay on the photographer&#x2019;s exceptional capacity to capture the diverse built environment of Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><p><p>Christopher James Alexander is assistant curator of architecture and design at the Getty Research Institute and co-curator of the 2007 traveling exhibition <i>Julius Shulman&#x2019;s Los Angeles.</i></p></p><h2>High Dose Therapy and Transplantation of Haemopoietic Stem Cells: (2001)</h2><p>High-dose therapy with allogeneic or autologous stem celltransplantation as well as additional supportive measures havebrought important advances in the therapy of malignantdiseases.<br>Allogeneic and especially autologous peripheral blood stem cellgrafting as opposed to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is asubject of intensive research. <p>� The scientific papers presented in this volume centre onhaematological malignancies.<br>� They are notable among the various current attempts toimprove the therapy of cancer.<br>� Novel treatment strategies are described, in whichimmunological techniques, the introduction of new pharmaceuticals,of biological factors and genetic engineering emerge as promisingtools.<br>The volume is a comprehensive account of the Workshop held in April2001 in Bad Saarow/Berlin, Germany, the 5th of its kind in the pastdecade.</p><p>With its international team of authors, the book presents thestate of the art in the field of high-dose therapy of malignant andnon-malignant diseases.</p></p><p></p><h2>Knowing Feeling: Affect, Script, and Psychotherapy (Norton Professional Books (Hardcover))</h2><p><p><strong>Nathanson and his colleagues explore contemporary affect studies, focusing on the work of Silvan Tomkins, and examine their impact on the theory and practice of psychotherapy.</strong></p></p><p>This is a book about knowing feeling in all its aspects - and the difference that makes in psychotherapy. It is the first book to present specific therapeutic techniques and ways of looking at the human condition based on the Tomkins-Nathanson theory of emotion. Once grasped, Tomkins&#39;s affect theory illuminates both the small moments when shame takes over and the large patterns of human emotional interaction. As the contributors demonstrate in these wide-ranging essays, it provides new ways to understand intimacy, human sexuality, and the relationship between infants and their caregivers. It changes the way one assesses a client, forms a diagnostic alliance, or does research on shame and guilt. In clinical chapters, readers will find that understanding the basic affects - interest-excitement, enjoyment-joy, surprise-startle, fear-terror, distress-anguish, anger-rage, dissmell, disgust, and shame-humiliation - gives direction and richness to the practice of marital therapy, cognitive therapy, psychopharmacology, art therapy, psychoanalysis, and Jungian depth therapy. It can be applied to the treatment of trauma following abuse or war, in dramatic role-playing for such PTSD patients, in the remediation of young criminals, and even in the theater. This is an ambitious and wide-ranging work. Nathanson&#39;s thought-provoking chapter introductions provide continuity and bridges. Readers open to new possibilities are likely to find that their ways of practicing therapy and of being in the world are profoundly changed by what they learn here.Donald L. Nathanson, M.D., (1936&#x2013;2018) was the founder and Executive Director of the Silvan S. Tomkins Institute.

This environment of constant change will only accelerate in the future and traditional business leaders are ill equipped to deal with it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Just as we took our cues from MBAs and the military in casting the ideal CEO of the 20th century, we can look to design - in its broadest form - to model our future leader, the DEO. These leaders possess characteristics, behaviors and mindsets that allow them to excel in unpredictable, fast-moving and value-charged conditions. They are catalysts for transformation and agents of change. A hybrid of strategic business executive and creative problem-solver, the DEO is willing to take on anything as an object of design and looks at ALL problems as design challenges.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> Readers will learn not only why this form of leadership is essential to the success of modern organizations, but also what characteristics are best suited to this role. Through intimate conversations with leading DEOs, we explore the mindsets, communities, processes and practices common to creative business leaders. The book lays out&#x2014;graphically and through example&#x2014;how DEOs run their companies and why this approach makes sense now. We help readers identify these skills in themselves and their colleagues, and we guide them in using these skills to build, revive or reinvent the next generation of great companies and organization.</p><p><br> Maria Giudice<br> Innovator, artist, protagonist, and positive provocateur, Maria has pursued a vision of intelligent, elegant, people-centered design throughout her professional life. Her grasp of the pragmatic, the authentic, and the essential have kept her at the forefront of design and business for over 20 years. Under Maria's leadership, Hot Studio, the experience design firm she founded in 1997, grew into a full-service creative agency with an impressive list of Fortune 500 clients. In March 2013, Facebook acquired the talent behind Hot Studio in one of their largest "acqui-hires" to date, where Maria now works as Director of Product Design. She has spoken at conferences all over the world and co-teaches a Business and Design course at the California College of the Arts with Christopher Ireland. <br> Christopher Ireland<br> Researcher, strategist, idea generator and alliance builder, Christopher started her career with the notion that businesses could benefit from a better understanding of people and culture. Her ability to create simple explanations of complex human behavior and to translate those insights into effective design and development strategies attracted a wide range of clients including Microsoft, HP, Pepsi, Levis, Gap and more. As a co-founder and CEO of Cheskin, a firm that pioneered design research in Silicon Valley, Christopher had a ring-side seat to unrivaled feats of creation, innovation and reinvention."The most resilient companies and institutions of today are not machines, they are wonderfully complex organisms. They require intentional leadership and thoughtful nurturing. 'Chief Decision Maker' no longer cuts it.

Here is an inspirational and accessible code-base for effective leadership in the 21st century." --Tim Brown, CEO IDEO<br> <br> "Giudice and Ireland provide a simple, detailed path to becoming a successful creative leader. The DEO chooses to lead out in the open instead of from behind a closed door, to fail fast instead of fear failing, to care for the micro-details instead of micromanaging. Their creative collaboration is certain to spark a new generation of executives who learn to lead as designers, and designers who might make their way to becoming the next DEO." --John Maeda, Author of <i>Laws of Simplicity</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Redesigning Leadership,&nbsp;</i>President, Rhode Island School of Design <br>"Rise of the DEO identifies a new generation of leaders who combine traits we typically think of as opposites.

Tron, Marion City Schools USA</p><h2>The Origins of Jewish Mysticism</h2><p><p><i>The Origins of Jewish Mysticism</i> offers the first in-depth look at the history of Jewish mysticism from the book of Ezekiel to the Merkavah mysticism of late antiquity. The Merkavah movement is widely recognized as the first full-fledged expression of Jewish mysticism, one that had important ramifications for classical rabbinic Judaism and the emergence of the Kabbalah in twelfth-century Europe. Yet until now, the origins and development of still earlier forms of Jewish mysticism have been largely overlooked.</p><p> In this book, Peter Sch�fer sheds new light on Ezekiel's tantalizing vision, the apocalyptic literature of Enoch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the writings of the Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo, the rabbinical writings of the Talmudic period, and the esotericism of the Merkavah mystics. Sch�fer questions whether we can accurately speak of Jewish mysticism as a uniform, coherent phenomenon with origins in Judaism's mythical past. Rather than imposing preconceived notions about "mysticism" on a great variety of writings that arose from different cultural, religious, and historical settings, he reveals what these writings seek to tell us about the age-old human desire to get close to and communicate with God.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Origins of Jewish Mysticism</i> is the culmination of a lifetime of scholarship by one of the most important figures in the field. Full of fresh and convincing interpretations, it is among the most significant works on Jewish mysticism to appear in decades."<b>--Philip Alexander, University of Manchester</b></p><p>"With great acumen and ingenuity, Sch�fer refutes the currently popular idea that there was an uninterrupted continuum from the earliest Jewish apocalypses and the Dead Sea Scrolls to the mystical Hekhalot literature of late antiquity. His book is a very sobering reminder that the origins of Jewish mysticism still remain by and large shrouded in darkness."<b>--Pieter W. van der Horst, professor emeritus, Utrecht University</b></p><b>Peter Sch�fer</b> is the Ronald O. Perelman Professor of Jewish Studies and professor of religion at Princeton University.

Born in Westphalia in 1651, Kaempfer traveled throughout the Near and Far East before settling in Japan as physician to the trading settlement of the Dutch East India Company at Nagasaki. During his two years residence, he made two extensive trips around Japan in 1691 and 1692, collecting, according to the British historian Boxer, "an astonishing amount of valuable and accurate information." He also learned all he could from the few Japanese who came to Deshima for instruction in the European sciences.</p><p>To these observations, Kaempfer added details he had gathered from a wide reading of travelers' accounts and the reports of previous trading delegations. The result was the first scholarly study of Tokugawa Japan in the West, a work that greatly influenced the European view of Japan throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, serving as a reference for a variety of works ranging from encyclopedias to the libretto of "The Mikado."</p><p>Kaempfer's work remains one of the most valuable sources for historians of the Tokugawa period. The narrative describes what no Japanese was permitted to record (the details of the shogun's castle, for example) and what no Japanese thought worthy of recording (the minutiae of everyday life). However, all previous translations of the <i>History</i> are flawed, being based on the work of an eighteenth-century Swiss translator or that of the German editor some fifty years later who had little knowledge of Japan and resented Kaempfer's praise of the heathen country. Beatrice Bodart-Bailey's impressive new translation of this classic, which reflects careful study of Kaempfer's original manuscript, reclaims the work for the modern reader, placing it in the context of what is currently known about Tokugawa Japan and restoring the humor and freshness of Kaempfer's observations and impressions. In Kaempfer's Japan we have, for the first time, an accurate and thoroughly readable annotated translation of Kaempfer's colorful account of pre-modern Japan.</p></p><p><b>Beatrice M.

According to Landau, these theories are versions of the universal hero tale in folklore and myth. The narratives all have similar structures, featuring a humble hero (in theories of evolution it is a nonhuman primate) who departs on a journey (leaves his native habitat), receives essential aid or equipment from a donor figure (through evolutionary principles such as natural selection or orthogenesis), goes through tests (imposed by competitors, harsh climate, or predators), and finally arrives at a higher (that is, more human) state.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Analyzing classic texts on evolution by Darwin, Keith, and Elliott Smith, as well as more recent authors by scholars such as Dart, Robinson, Tobias, and Johanson, Landau reveals not only their common narrative form but also how this form accommodates differences in meaning&#x2014;widely varying sequences of events, heroes, and donors. Landau shows how interpretations of the fossil record differ according to what the anthropologist believes it the primary evolutionary agent. She concludes that scientists have much to gain from an awareness that they are tellers of stories. An understanding of narrative, she argues, can provide tools for creating new scientific theories as well as for analyzing old ones. Her book will be entertaining and enlightening for both general readers and scholars. </p></p><p></p><h2>Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn&#39;t</h2><p>The formal education of an electrical engineer is primarily mathematics and theory, with little practical information taught.

I'll tell you the real story--I swear I will."--from <i>Little One</i> by Toge Sankichi</p><br><p> Three Japanese authors of note--Hara Tamiki, Ota Yoko, and Toge Sankichi--survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima only to shoulder an appalling burden: bearing witness to ultimate horror. Between 1945 and 1952, in prose and in poetry, they published the premier first-person accounts of the atomic holocaust. Forty-five years have passed since August 6, 1945, yet this volume contains the first complete English translation of Hara's <i>Summer Flowers</i>, the first English translation of Ota's <i>City of Corpses</i>, and a new translation of Toge's <i>Poems of the Atomic Bomb</i>. No reader will emerge unchanged from reading these works. Different from each other in their politics, their writing, and their styles of life and death, Hara, Ota, and Toge were alike in feeling compelled to set down in writing what they experienced. Within forty-eight hours of August 6, before fleeing the city for shelter in the hills west of Hiroshima, Hara jotted down this note: "Miraculously unhurt; must be Heaven's will that I survive and report what happened." Ota recorded her own remarks to her half-sister as they walked down a street littered with corpses: "I'm looking with two sets of eyesthe eyes of a human being and the eyes of a writer." And the memorable words of Toge quoted above come from a poem addressed to a child whose father was killed in the South Pacific and whose mother died on August 6th--who would tell of that day? The works of these three authors convey as much of the "real story" as can be put into words.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>Body Movement: Coping with the Environment</h2><p>"'Irmgard Bartenieff has a profound knowledge of the human body and how it moves.

She continued her work with an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at UNM followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Keller didn&#x2019;t set out to be an author, but as she home schooled her three children, her scientific background, coupled with her love of learning, brought her to a decisive point in her career. Taking the plunge, she decided to leave academia and develop a series of science books for kids. Dr. Keller has written for the Christian home school market for over eight years, and having been in an academic setting for most of her adult career, Dr. Keller understands the issues faced by both religious and secular parents. The Real Science-4-Kids books are Dr. Keller&#x2019;s answer to the difficult territory teachers and parents navigate as they try to sort through the various philosophical perspectives found in science. Real Science-4-Kids is written as a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that Dr. Keller hopes will not only provide students with a solid foundation for science, but also give them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Dr. Keller does not believe we should rely on the &#x201c;experts&#x201d; but instead learn how to critically evaluate every scientific claim. &#x201c;In this uncertain economy with so many social, scientific, and economic problems, it is not enough to teach our kids what to learn.&#x201d; says Dr. Keller, &#x201c;We must also teach them how to learn and we must also encourage our kids to learn from others. Part of learning from others is to know how to engage in productive debate.&#x201d; Today, Real Science-4-Kids, with its easy-to-use teacher-friendly manuals and engaging, kid-friendly text, is used in 50 states as well as Australia, Canada, Japan and Korea. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s publishing team continues to develop and test products at her Albuquerque headquarters.<p><em>"My children and I love everything about this science curriculum!!

Page after page of this stunning book shows you the beauties and benefits of a natural garden. And a garden that takes its inspiration from nature is a beacon to birds, butterflies, toads, and other wild creatures. Author Sally Roth has a lifetime's experience creating natural landscapes. In this beautifully designed, lavishly illustrated book, she tells you everything you need to know about creating a natural landscape. You'll find:<br><br>* Chapters on meadow and prairie gardens, woodland and shade gardens, water and bog gardens, gardens for songbirds and hummingbirds, and gardens to attract butterflies and moths.<br>* Step-by-step projects for building special garden features. The easy-to-follow instructions and illustrations take you through the basics of creating such exciting garden additions as a waterfall and a bluebird nest box. You'll learn how to install garden lighting to add a glow to walkways, create a bubbling spring for birds, build a rustic bench, and more.<br>* Garden plans for such varied gardens as a moonlight garden, a birdseed garden, and a hummingbird garden. You'll find nine beautifully illustrated plans that show you exactly how to create special natural gardens. You can follow the plans exactly or adapt them for your own needs.<br>* Effective gardening techniques, each explained with step-by-step illustrations. You'll learn the easiest way to strip sod for a new garden, how to saw through a limb without damaging the tree, an effortless way to propagate your plants, and how to control problems organically. With these simple instructions, every gardener-- even a beginner-- can create and maintain a lush natural landscape.<br>* Profiles of delightful natural landscapes created by gardeners across the country. Each profile features a different kind of natural landscape, from a prairie planting to a butterfly garden to a yard designed just for the birds. The gardeners talk about their inspirations and share valuable tips on how to create your own version.<br>* Scores of quick-reference charts show you the best plants for every type of natural landscape. No matter where you live, you'll find a selection of the best plants for your area-- whether you're looking for flowers to attract hummingbirds, grasses for a prairie garden, shrubs for your woodland garden, plants to soften a pool's edge, flowers for a night garden, or wildflowers for your sunny meadow garden. You'll find helpful charts of the best plants for each garden style, conveniently located at the end of each chapter.<br><br>With lively, authoritative text and more than 250 gorgeous color photos and illustrations, <i>Natural Landscaping</i> is an indispensable guide to a lush, inviting garden that's full of the beauty of nature.</p><p><i>Natural Landscaping</i> is an intelligent and quietly compelling guide for naturalizing the garden. <i>Country Living Gardener</i> editor Sally Roth relies on decades of organic gardening experience, personal anecdotes, and a belief in working in concert with Mother Nature to restore native ecosystems. In the tradition of gardening manuals, she offers best-of lists for everything from grasses for prairie gardens to flowers for a night garden to plants to soften a pool's edge, always stressing the overarching importance of flora-fauna harmony. She also includes helpful tips and sidebars on bird-nest materials, unique ground covers, building dry streambeds, and making homemade sap for butterflies. There's a solid chapter on wall and path design and welcome field-guide information on water wildlife, birds, and butterflies. Roth's tone is warm throughout, and she further personalizes the book by including sidebars about other gardeners and their gardens. Grassland, woodland, and freshwater-area ecosystems are covered, although information on coastal or arid areas is absent. For readers in the Southwest, <i>Desert Landscaping</i> would be a better choice. <p> The real shine of <i>Natural Landscaping</i> is in the details on creating a natural habitat that is self-contained and self-perpetuating. For instance, one can plant a butterfly bush to attract butterflies, but what perennial will butterflies lay their eggs in for next year? Instead of fighting a never-ending battle of trapping and killing moles, let these insect-eating creatures tunnel their homes and aerate your soil. Your first impulse may be to tidily clear away fallen wood, but why not position it ornamentally and nourish the soil at the same time? The book is full of this kind of sensible wisdom. It's clear Roth has taken her lessons from Mother Nature seriously. <i>--Karen Karleski</i></p><p><i>Natural Landscaping</i><br>Let Mother Nature be your guide to gorgeous, low-maintenance landscaping!</p><p>Now you can turn your yard into a backyard paradise-- and you don't need a big yard or a big budget to do it! With a few square feet of garden space, you can have a colorful wildflower meadow that will attract birds and butterflies to your yard. If you have a single shade tree, you can have a woodland garden. And you can create a water garden-- complete with waterfall-- in a space the size of a bathtub! Whether you want to create a small garden where nature can hold sway or convert your entire yard into a beautiful natural area, <i>Natural Landscaping</i> is packed with tips, techniques, and garden ideas to make your dreams a reality.</p><p>"In <i>Natural Landscaping</i>, Sally Roth creates a very personal vision of nature and the gardener's place in the natural world. She presents a persuasive argument for having birds and butterflies in our daily lives, and offers a wealth of ideas and projects to attract and keep them. The ideas presented in this book apply well beyond the confines of the backyard. After reading this book you might just give your front yard to wildlife, too."<br>--C.

Her down-to-earth analysis of six social identity categories reveals how communication establishes and enacts identity and power dynamics. She provides historical overviews to show how perceptions of gender, race, social, class, sexuality, ability and age have varied throughout time and place. Allen clearly explains pertinent theoretical perspectives and illustrates those and other discussions with real-life experiences (many of which are her own). She also offers practical guidance for how to communicate difference more humanely. While many examples are from organizational contexts, readers from a wide range of backgrounds can relate to them and appreciate their relevance.<br><br>This eye-opening, vibrant text, suitable for use in a variety of disciplines, motivates readers to think about valuing difference as a positive, enriching feature of society.

Shalev argues that the effort to shape the United States as a biblical nation reflected conflicting attitudes within the culture&#x2014;proudly boastful on the one hand but uncertain about its abilities and ultimate destiny on the other.&nbsp;With great nuance, <i>American Zion</i> explores for the first time the meaning and lasting effects of the idea of the United States as a new Israel and sheds new light on our understanding of the nation&#x2019;s origins and culture during the founding and antebellum decades.</p><br></p><p><p>This original book examines the widespread notion in America&#x2019;s early decades that the United States was a second or new Israel, an idea that powerfully influenced nationalism, politics, and culture.</p><b>Eran Shalev</b> is a senior lecturer in the History Department at Haifa University, Israel.</p><h2>Flip Your Classroom: Reaching Every Student in Every Class Every Day</h2><p>It started with a simple observation: Students need their teachers present to answer questions or to provide help if they get stuck on an assignment; they don&#x2019;t need their teachers present to listen to a lecture or review content. From there, Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams began the flipped classroom: Students watched recorded lectures for homework and completed their assignments, labs, and tests in class with their teacher available. What Bergmann and Sams found was that their students demonstrated a deeper understanding of the material than ever before.

Wells's science fiction classic, the first novel to explore the possibilities of intelligent life from other planets, it still startling and vivid nearly after a century after its appearance, and a half-century after Orson Wells's infamous 1938 radio adaptation. The daring portrayal of aliens landing on English soil, with its themes of interplanetary imperialism, technological holocaust and chaos, is central to the career of H.G. Wells, who died at the dawn of the atomic age. The survival of mankind in the face of "vast and cool and unsympathetic" scientific powers spinning out of control was a crucial theme throughout his work. Visionary, shocking and chilling, <i>The War Of The Worlds</i> has lost none of its impact since its first publication in 1898.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p><p> H. G. Wells&#x2019;s <em>The War of the Worlds</em>, the first story to speculate about the consequences of aliens (from Mars) with superior technology landing on earth, is one of the most influential science fiction books ever written. The novel is both a thrilling narrative and an elaboration of Wells&#x2019;s socio-political thought on the subjects of imperialism, humankind&#x2019;s treatment of other animals, and unquestioning faith in military technology and the continuation of the human species. </p> <p> This edition&#x2019;s appendices include other related writings by Wells; selected correspondence; contemporary reviews; excerpts from works that influenced the novel and from contemporary invasion narratives; and photographs of examples of Victorian military technology. </p></p><h2>Mechanics of Materials (Masteringengineering)</h2><p><b> <i>Mechanics of Materials </i> </b>helps students gain physical and intuitive understanding of the ideas underlying the mechanics of materials; grasp big picture ideas; and use the subject to solve problems&#x2013;everything it takes to genuinely learn how the forces acting on a material relate to its deformation and failure.</p><p><b>Professor Paul S.

Her vision holds out the difficult promise of a truly democratic American identity whose possibilities are no longer limited and disfigured by race.</p><p>In this brilliant and indispensable study of the making of segregationist culture, Grace Elizabeth Hale shows how what W. E. B. Du Bois called the "color line" came to define American identity itself: whiteness became the standard, desirable image of aspiring middle-class life while blackness was consigned to the margins, to the back of the bus, and became a marker, for a white majority, of social pathology. Nowhere was the identification of blackness with inferiority more obsessively enforced than in the South, where the law cast a blind eye on lynching as public entertainment and where white children were taught that Negroes "must be kept in their place."<p>Drawing on a fascinating and often disturbing array of cultural artifacts and events, Making Whiteness shatters the habitual assumption that racism is an unfortunate fact of human nature, and points the way toward a truly egalitarian and integrated society.</p>Grace Elizabeth Hale is an assistant professor of American history at the University of Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;She lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><h2>Frankenstein (1831 Edition): 200th Anniversary Collection</h2><p><p><b>1831 Edition</b></p><p>Unlike reviews that may state otherwise, this edition (1) Is the correct 1831 edition, (2) has a high quality cover and inside illustration, (3) has a cover from a Frankenstein publication from last century, (4) has had all chapter numbers changed to roman numerals like the original.

The wall is coated with thick grey plaster, cracked and crumbling in places so the stone shows through. It&#x2019;s almost dark in the corridor. It smells of earth and age, and it&#x2019;s silent. But I&#x2019;m not afraid; I&#x2019;m never afraid there. I reach up and move my writing finger in the motions I know, in the right place, in the air, not quite touching the surface of the plaster. The door opens in the wall, and I go in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in that room is clear and calm, falling from many small skylights of thick glass in the high ceiling. It&#x2019;s a very long room, with shelves down its wall, and books on the shelves. It&#x2019;s my room, and I&#x2019;ve always known it. Ista and Sosta and Gudit don&#x2019;t. They don&#x2019;t even know it&#x2019;s there. They never come to these corridors far in the back of the house. I pass the Waylord&#x2019;s door to come here, but he&#x2019;s sick and lame and stays in his rooms. The secret room is my secret, the place where I can be alone, and not scolded and bothered, and not afraid.<br>&nbsp;The memory isn&#x2019;t of one time I went there, but many. I remember how big the reading table looked to me then, and how high the bookshelves were. I liked to get under the table and build a kind of wall or shelter with some of the books. I pretended to be a bear cub in its den. I felt safe there. I always put the books back exactly where they belonged on the shelves; that was important. I stayed in the lighter part of the room, near the door that&#x2019;s not a door. I didn&#x2019;t like the farther end, where it grows dark and the ceiling comes down lower. In my mind I called that the shadow end, and I almost always stayed away from it. But even my fear of the shadow end was part of my secret, my kingdom of solitude. And it was mine alone, until one day when I was nine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosta had been scolding me for some stupid thing that wasn&#x2019;t my fault, and when I was rude back to her she called me &#x201c;sheep hair,&#x201d; which put me in a fury. I couldn&#x2019;t hit her because her arms were longer and she could hold me off, so I bit her hand. Then her mother, my bymother Ista, scolded me and cuffed me. Furious, I ran to the back part of the house, to the dark corridor, and opened the door and went into the secret room. I was going to stay there till Ista and Sosta thought I&#x2019;d run away and been taken as a slave and was gone forever, and then they&#x2019;d be sorry for scolding unjustly and cuffing and calling me names. I rushed into the secret room all hot and full of tears and rage&#x2014; and there, in the strange clear light of that place, stood the Waylord with a book in his hands.<br>&nbsp;He was startled, too. He came at me, fierce, his arm raised as if to strike. I stood like a stone. I could not breathe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped short. &#x201c;Memer! How did you come here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the place where the door is when it&#x2019;s open, but of course nothing was there but the wall.<br>&nbsp;I still couldn&#x2019;t breathe or speak.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I left it open,&#x201d; he said, without believing what he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head.<br>&nbsp;Finally I was able to whisper, &#x201c;I know how.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;His face was shocked and amazed, but after a while it changed, and he said, &#x201c;Decalo.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;I nodded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother&#x2019;s name was Decalo Galva.<br>&nbsp;I want to tell of her, but I can&#x2019;t remember her. Or I do but the memory won&#x2019;t go into words. Being held tight, jostling, a good smell in the darkness of the bed, a rough red cloth, a voice which I can&#x2019;t hear but it&#x2019;s only just out of hearing. I used to think if I could hold still and listen hard enough, I&#x2019;d hear her voice.<br>&nbsp;She was a Galva by blood and by house. She was head housekeeper for Sulter Galva, Waylord of Ansul, an honorable and responsible position. In Ansul there were no serfs or slaves then; we were citizens, householders, free people. My mother Decalo was in charge of all the people who worked in Galvamand. My bymother Ista, the cook, liked to tell us about how big the household used to be, back then, how many people Decalo had to look after. Ista herself had two kitchen assistants every day, and three helpers for the big dinners for visiting notables; there were four housecleaners, and the handyman, and a groom and stableboy for the horses, eight horses in the stable, some to ride and some to drive. There were quite a few relatives and old people living in the house. Ista&#x2019;s mother lived up over the kitchens, the Waylord&#x2019;s mother lived in the Master&#x2019;s rooms upstairs. The Waylord himself was always travelling up and down the Ansul Coast from town to town to meet with the other waylords, sometimes in the saddle, sometimes in a carriage with a retinue. There was a smithy in the west court in those days, and the driver and postboy lived on the top floor of the carriage house, always ready to go out with the Waylord on his rounds. &#x201c;Oh it was all busy and abustle,&#x201d; Ista says. &#x201c;The old days! The good days!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I ran through the silent corridors past the ruined rooms, I used to try to imagine those days, the good days. I used to pretend, when I swept the doorways, that I was making ready for guests who&#x2019;d come through them wearing fine clothes and shoes. I used to go up to the Master&#x2019;s rooms and imagine how they&#x2019;d looked clean and warm and furnished. I&#x2019;d kneel in the windowseat there to look out through the clear, small-paned window over the roofs of the city to the mountain.<br>&nbsp;The name of my city and all the coast north of it, Ansul, means &#x201c;Looking at Sul&#x201d;&#x2014; the great mountain, last and highest of the five peaks of Manva, the land across the straits. From the seafront and from all the western windows of the city you can see white Sul above the water, and the clouds it gathers round it as if they were its dreams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew the city had been called Ansul the Wise and Beautiful for its university and library, its towers and arcaded courts, its canals and arched bridges and the thousand little marble temples of the street-gods. But the Ansul of my childhood was a broken city of ruins, hunger, and fear.&nbsp;Ansul was a protectorate of Sundraman, but that great nation was busy fighting over its border with Loaman and kept no troops here to defend us. Though rich in goods and farmland, Ansul had long fought no wars. Our well-armed merchant fleet kept pirates from the south from harrying the coast, and since Sundraman enforced an alliance with us long ago, we had had no enemies by land. So when an army of Alds, the people of the deserts of Asudar, invaded us, they swept over the hills of Ansul like wildfire. Their army broke into the city and went through the streets murdering, looting, and raping. My mother Decalo, caught in the street coming from the market, was taken by soldiers and raped. Then the soldiers who had her were attacked by citizens, and in the fighting she managed to get away and get home to Galvamand.<br>&nbsp;Copyright � 2006 by Ursula K. Le Guin<br>All rights reserved.

Jane Eyre, a novel of stunning power, romance and suspense, was an instant bestseller in 1847.

Her passionate romance with rich, brooding Mr. Rochester, and her discovery of his devastating secret, forces her to choose between love and self-respect. Jane Eyre is the story of every woman who struggles for equality and dignity in a society that wants to deny her that right--as true in Victorian England as it is today.</p><p></p><h2>Demons</h2><p>This title comes from the award-winning translators of &#34;Crime and Punishment&#34;, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. Based on a real-life crime which horrified Russia in 1869, Dostoevsky intended his novel to castigate the fanaticism of his country&#39;s new revolutionaries, particularly those known as Nihilists. Blackly funny, grotesque and shocking, it is a disturbing portrait of five young men saturated in ideology and bent on destruction, and a compelling study of terrorism.</p><p>The award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky continue their acclaimed series of Dostoevsky translations with this novel, also known as "The Possessed. <br>Inspired by the true story of a political murder that horrified Russians in 1869, Dostoevsky conceived of "Demons as a "novel-pamphlet" in which he would say everything about the plague of materialist ideology that he saw infecting his native land. What emerged was a prophetic and ferociously funny masterpiece of ideology and murder in prerevolutionary Russia--a novel that is rivalled only by "The Brothers Karamazov as Dostoevsky's greatest.Fyodor Dostoevsky was born in Moscow on 11th November 1821. He had six siblings and his mother died in 1837 and his father in 1839. He graduated from the St Petersburg Academy of Military Engineering in 1846 but decided to change careers and become a writer. His first book, Poor Folk, did very well but on 23rd April 1849 he was arrested for subversion and sentenced to death. After a mock-execution his sentence was commuted to hard labour in Siberia where he developed epilepsy.He was released in 1854. His 1860 book, The House of the Dead was based on these experiences. In 1857 he married Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva. After his release he adopted more conservative and traditional values and rejected his previous socialist position. In the following years he spent a lot of time abroad, struggled with an addiction to gambling and fell deeply in debt. His wife died in 1864 and he married Anna Grigoryeva Snitkina. In the following years he published his most enduring and successful books, including Crime and Punishment (1865). He died on 9th February 1881.</p><h2>Sacred Signs: Hieroglyphs in Ancient Egypt</h2><p>The hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt have fascinated people for over three thousand years. In this engaging new study, Penelope Wilson offers a wide ranging look at this ancient form of writing, touching on everything from basic principles of translation to its broader function in Egyptian culture. <br> <em>Sacred Signs</em> illuminates the cultural significance of hieroglyphs, showing how it was used in monumental art and as the rarified language of the gods. Wilson points out that the Egyptian word for pictorial writing was "medu-netjer," which means "words of god." Hieroglyphs were an exalted mode of communication, used to speak with the gods or to guide rulers in the afterlife (for instance, hieroglyphs might describe a set of spells, rituals, and the route to the afterlife for use by the king or queen). Indeed, hieroglyphs differed from everyday writing and the average Egyptian was unable to read them--only the elite were taught the pictorial signs. Throughout the book, Wilson illuminates the writing system itself. We learn that hieroglyphs can be read either left-to-right or right-to-left and that animals, birds, people, serpents, and fish were drawn in profile, all facing the same way, so that readers would know which way to read the line. Also, individual signs derived from everyday objects in the Egyptian world, so that learning hieroglyphs is not only a linguistic exercise, but also an insightful introduction to Egyptian culture and daily life.<br> Written by an authority on hieroglyphics, <em>Sacred Signs</em> is the only book available that presents up-to-date evidence in an accessible way, illuminating the function and importance of hieroglyphs within the framework of ancient Egyptian culture.</p><p><br><strong>Penelope Wilson</strong> is Lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Durham, and Field Director for the Egyptian Exploration Society Mission to Sais in Egypt.

For every young woman who has asked herself that question, this book offers a breathtaking vision of hope. Refreshingly candid and practical, Authentic Beauty explores the boundless opportunities God has for a young woman who is willing to let Him shape every aspect of her life.</p><p>Leslie Ludy is a young woman with a powerful message of hope for her generation.

Leslie and Eric enjoy an adventure-filled existence together in the beautiful state of Colorado.The Erosion of a Feminine Dream<br>IT HAPPENED WHEN I was six.<br><br>Somewhere between my encounter with the breathtaking heroine in Walt Disney&#x2019;s <i>Sleeping Beauty </i>and my introduction to Malibu Barbie (who came complete with five evening gowns and a hot-pink convertible), I made my decision. Somewhere between watching the lovely Sugar Plum Fairy twirling around on stage during a local production of <i>The Nutcracker </i>and trying on my mother&#x2019;s satiny wedding dress, I decided beyond a shadow of a doubt exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up...a beautiful princess. The fact that princesses were unheard-of in modern-day America did not bother me. I was convinced that somehow, someway, someday I would become one. It was not that I considered myself especially beautiful or princesslike. In fact, staring into the bathroom mirror one morning at my stringy hair and crooked teeth, I decided that the only remedy was a makeover, which I skillfully applied after digging in my mom&#x2019;s makeup drawer. (The story of my memorable venture out into public that day with my bright pink cheeks, dark green eyelids, and vibrant orange lips is quite an unfortunate tale.) That was the end of my makeup escapades for the time being, but I held out hope that one day I would grow into a dazzling beauty like Cathy Henderson (my all-time favorite baby-sitter), with her supercool, neon pink nail polish and Barbie-like locks. <br>But much more than polished nails and eternally good hair days, it seemed to me that the <i>really </i>necessary requirement for becoming a princess was to find a noble prince: a knight in shining armor who would consider me the most desirable girl in the world, sweep me off my feet, rescue me from peril, carry me away to his castle, and cherish me forever. Sleeping Beauty had Prince Charming. Malibu Barbie had Ken. The Sugar Plum Fairy had the Nutcracker. The Beautiful Bride (a.k.a. my mother) had the Handsome Groom (a.k.a. my father). Even Cathy Henderson had the curly haired Scotty Darnell wrapped around her finger. Finding a prince of my own seemed like a reasonable goal.<br>It was a childish dream, a girlish desire that budded in my heart long before I knew anything about the real world. But for some inexplicable reason, it was a dream that I longed to come true more than I had ever longed for anything in my entire life. I desperately wanted to become a princess. It was a dream that I treasured, even as I grew older. It was a desire that remained rooted deep within my heart long after Malibu Barbie and her convertible were packed away in Styrofoam peanuts up in the attic. But things were about to change, and change dramatically. In my early childhood innocence, I had no way of knowing the weighty price that would soon be demanded of a young girl who dares to enter the real world holding on to the foolish dream of becoming a princess...<br><br>THE DREAM BEGAN to fade when I was ten. I was standing by the water fountain with Mandy and Katie, my two fifth-grade bosom buddies. We were deeply engaged in an animated discussion about the many virtues of Sour Patch Kids, the latest candy craze to hit Crestview Elementary since Nerds had come on the scene a year before. Then, seemingly from out of nowhere, a small group of fifthgrade boys surrounded us, laughing obnoxiously and jolting Mandy out of an awe-inspiring tale of her recent attempt to eat <i>five </i>Sour Patch Kids all at the same time. Katie rolled her eyes and looked at the boys in annoyance.<br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; she demanded.<br>The ringleader, Andy Archibald, only smirked at Katie. Andy was a loud, skinny kid in baggy Levi&#x2019;s who brought three or four Twinkies in his lunch nearly every day of the week. (I had noticed this fact with great envy, since my mom was a health nut, and the &#x201c;treats&#x201d; in my lunchbox were usually carrot sticks and sugar-free granola bars.) <br>&#x201c;Go <i>away</i>!&#x201d; Katie ordered in an irritated voice. Andy didn&#x2019;t budge. His sly grin grew wider. He stepped a little closer to her. The rest of the boys began to snicker.<br>&#x201c;Timmy <i>likes </i>you,&#x201d; Andy finally announced triumphantly, as the snickering grew louder. Timmy immediately shoved Andy against the water fountain, protesting loudly with a swear word. I quickly looked around to see if any teachers had heard him. Fifth graders were not allowed to cuss in school (we were told that once we reached middle school we would be grown up enough to say whatever we wanted in the halls). I expected the Cussing Police to come rushing over, grab Timmy by the earlobe to drag him off to the principal&#x2019;s office, and force-feed him a bar of Dial. But no adult was anywhere in sight. I found myself strangely disappointed that Timmy&#x2019;s great sin had not created more of a scandal.<br>My thoughts on this were short-lived, however, because Andy had recovered from Timmy&#x2019;s outburst and seemed to be gaining momentum. &#x201c;Timmy thinks you&#x2019;re a <i>babe,</i>&#x201d; he crooned to Katie in his grating, prepubertized voice, as Timmy yelled, &#x201c;Shut <i>up, </i>dude!&#x201d;<br>Katie&#x2019;s face had turned bright red, and she was staring at the floor.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; piped in Jason Smits, a squirrelly kid with oversized glasses, &#x201c;Timmy thinks you&#x2019;re hot, cuz you re <i>de-vel-op-ing</i>!&#x201d; He pointed at Katie&#x2019;s chest. &#x201c;You have to wear a <i>training </i>bra!&#x201d; At this, the entire group of boys burst into wild, uncontrollable laughter. Katie pursed her lips together in humiliation and hugged her science book tightly against her chest. Mandy glared at the boys but remained speechless. I looked around the hallway again, realizing that there were still no adults anywhere near us to come to the rescue. I decided it was up to me to defend Katie&#x2019;s honor.<br>&#x201c;Leave her alone, you jerks!&#x201d; I burst out. I immediately wished I had kept my mouth shut. The hyper group of boys suddenly turned their full attention on me, and I went from feeling like Wonder Woman to Minnie Mouse in a matter of seconds. Andy curled his lip cynically and looked me up and down.<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, nudging the kid next to him, &#x201c;check out <i>this </i>ugly chick&#x2014;she&#x2019;s flatter than the plains of Kansas!&#x201d; The boys howled. Jason quickly opened his mouth to outdo Andy&#x2019;s insult, but before any more verbal abuse could occur, our teacher decided to appear.<br>&#x201c;Okay, boys and girls, let&#x2019;s get back in line. Our break is over. It&#x2019;s time for our science lesson!&#x201d; she called out happily, oblivious to the drama that had just unfolded. The snickering group of boys quickly dispersed, and we were herded into the classroom to learn about the exciting process of metamorphosis.<br>While Miss Thompson began her lecture on the larval stage of a caterpillar, I was vaguely aware of new, confusing emotions dancing around in my heart. Since I was only ten, I hadn&#x2019;t had much experience being scrutinized, criticized, and discarded by members of the opposite sex. It was a strange sensation, and it created a knot in my stomach that seemed to linger there all afternoon. Andy Archibald&#x2019;s words rang over and over in my ears. It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to work this way, I told myself in bewilderment. There was a marked difference, I noticed, in the way Andy Archibald had treated <i>me </i>and the way the beautiful princess was treated by her prince in all the stories I had grown up with. The men in the fairy tales treated women as valuable treasures, to be prized and cherished. The &#x201c;men&#x201d; in the fifth grade at Crestview Elementary seemed to treat us the same way they treated their soccer ball&#x2014;like something to be roughly kicked around for fun, then tossed unnoticed into a corner of the playground. The longer I sat thinking, the more I found it hard to believe that boys actually <i>noticed </i>which girls were wearing training bras and which were still wearing pink cotton undershirts, like me. I had never been insecure about it until that day; in fact, I had never really given it much thought. My friends and I were usually too busy discussing Sour Patch Kids and Care Bears to obsess over our bodies. And until that day by the water fountain, the boys in my class had always spent most of their energy trading baseball cards and telling the latest Peewee Herman jokes. But now, they seemed to have found a new, more exciting pastime&#x2014;tormenting us about how we looked.<br>Boys like Andy, Timmy, and Jason had always tried to irritate the girls by flipping their eyelids inside out or cracking all their knuckles at once. But now, overnight, they seemed to have realized that they could get a far bigger reaction from us by brutally teasing us about the fascinating new phrases they had learned last week from Miss Thompson in health class. They had started using new words like <i>developing, </i>or Katie&#x2019;s most recent downfall, <i>training bra. </i>Though Miss Thompson had emphatically explained that these matters were nothing to giggle or be ashamed about, the boys hadn&#x2019;t seemed to catch the part about not laughing. As for not being ashamed about it, I found myself suddenly wanting to ask Miss Thompson how a tenyear-old was <i>not </i>supposed to feel embarrassed while facing a group of boys howling about the fact that she had not yet developed. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that Miss Thompson and our new workbook called <i>My Body </i>were partly to blame for<br>this strange and unwelcome change that had come over the Crestview Elementary fifth-grade boys.<br>Another possibility I considered might somehow be related was the magazine that Andy Archibald had discovered under his older brother&#x2019;s bed. I had heard Andy telling Jason Smits all about it during Susie Montgomery&#x2019;s oral report on the planet Jupiter a few days before. From what I could tell, it was a magazine with nothing but pictures of women who apparently were not wearing very many clothes, and the boys used the word <i>babe </i>repeatedly as they whispe...</p><h2>Nietzsche, Genealogy, Morality (Philosophical Traditions)</h2><p>Written at the height of the philosopher's intellectual powers, Friedrich Nietzsche's <i>On the Genealogy of Morals</i> has become one of the key texts of recent Western philosophy. Its essayistic style affords a unique opportunity to observe many of Nietzsche's persisting concerns coming together in an illuminating constellation. A profound influence on psychoanalysis, antihistoricism, and poststructuralism and an abiding challenge to ethical theory, Nietzsche's book addresses many of the major philosophical problems and possibilities of modernity.<br><br>In this unique collection focusing on the <i>Genealogy</i>, twenty-five notable philosophers offer diverse discussions of the book's central themes and concepts. They explore such notions as <i>ressentiment</i>, asceticism, "slave" and "master" moralities, and what Nietzsche calls "genealogy" and its relation to other forms of inquiry in his work. The book presents a cross section of contemporary Nietzsche scholarship and philosophical investigation that is certain to interest philosophers, intellectual and cultural historians, and anyone concerned with one of the master thinkers of the modern age.</p><p><b>Richard Schacht</b> is Professor of Philosophy and Jubilee Professor of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His most recent books are <i>Nietzsche: Selections</i> (1993) and <i>Making Sense of Nietzsche</i> (1994).&#34;[These] polished and penetrating essays by leading Nietzsche scholars provide a thorough analysis and critique of Nietzsche&#39;s most standard academic work. Each of the central themes of this daring and complex uncovering of the morality that has dominated Western thought and psychology for almost 2,000 years is insightfully discussed in this illuminating and often critical series of essays. . . . An outstanding array of perspectives highly recommended to Nietzscheans and others.&#34;--Choice</p><h2>Extreme Leadership: Leaders, Teams and Situations Outside the Norm (New Horizons in Leadership Studies series)</h2><p>Much has been written about how leaders and teams function in traditional business settings, but there is comparatively scant literature on the behaviors of leaders and teams facing extreme situations: that is, situations that fall outside the scope of daily experience. This book presents cases drawn from a diverse set of non-traditional and extreme leadership scenarios, offering a fresh perspective on both leadership research and management practice.<p>This groundbreaking volume features expert contributions from across the globe by both management scholars and business leaders. Divided into three main parts - Extreme Expedition Leaders, Extreme Work Teams and Extreme Individual Leaders - the book explores both specific instances of non-traditional leadership and their theoretical and practical implications. Examples discussed include polar and mountaineering expeditions such as Shackleton's Endurance expedition, survival and rescue efforts such as the Chilean mine cave-in, security and police crises such as the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and groundbreaking media and entertainment leaders such as Francis Ford Coppola and Glenn Miller.</p><p>This unique volume will appeal to students and professors of leadership and management studies, as well as managers, executives and other corporate business leaders.</p><p><b>Contributors</b>: S.E.

What is the photograph&#x2019;s place in writing the history of sculpture? How has it changed according to culture, generation, criti-cal conviction, and changes in media? <i>Photography and Sculpture: The Art Object in Reproduction </i>studies aspects of these questions from the perspectives of sixteen leading art historians. Their essays consider iconic photographs, archival collections, new and forgotten technologies, and conceptual challenges in photographing three-dimensional forms that have directed changing historical and stylistic attitudes about how we see, write about, and narrate histories of sculpture. Chapters on such varied topics as picturing Conceptual art, manipulating sacred images in India to be non-photographs, and framing Roman art with an iPad illustrate the latent visual and narrative powers and ever-expanding potential of these images of sculpture.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Sarah Hamill is assistant&nbsp;professor of modern and&nbsp;contemporary art at Oberlin College.

Accordingly, history, far from being &#x2018;fixed&#x2019; in time, is fluid and is re-made to serve contemporary agendas in the present. Part II addresses the question of materials and approaches to making history. By using material more commonly within the domain of artists, collectors or geographers and archaeologists, public historians have opened up understandings of the past. Part III looks at the way in which presentations of the past change over time and their different forms and emphases. Throughout, the Reader emphasizes the challenges for public historians today.</p> <p>Using their own expertise in constructing and teaching a Public History MA, Hilda Kean and Paul Martin have suggested themes and indicative extracts that draw on their understanding of what works best with students. <i>The Public History Reader</i> is a perfect resource for all students of public history and all those interested in understanding the role of the past in our lives today.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr Hilda Kean</strong> is former dean and director of public history at Ruskin college, Oxford where she established the first MA in Public History in Britain.

It is characterised by its generous reach: it includes work and ideas from many countries; it stresses the diverse forms public history takes and the range of communities that actively participate in making it; it shows how it can be innovative and challenge settled assumptions about both the past and its representation. This book will help its readers think in an engaged yet critical manner about the processes and social practices underpinning public history, and its complex, sometimes disturbing resonances in everyday life, for example, when atrocities need to be recognised and understood. Hilda Kean and Paul Martin have provided an extremely useful point of access to one of the most lively and important parts of history today." - <strong>Ludmilla Jordanova, </strong><em>King's College London, UK</em></p> <p>"This will become an essential text for all those interested in the interrogation of everyday experience, who regard history as a social form of knowledge, the work of a thousand different hands.

In this volume they have brought together not only some of its leading texts but embraced its rich cross-disciplinary appeal, drawing upon film makers, novelists and curators as well as those who have taught history, geography or anthropology. Conscientiously researched, insightful and intelligently compiled, this is a crucial compendium for all who want to understand the rich discourses of public history." - <strong>Paul Gough, </strong><em>University of the West of England, UK</em></p> <p>"Enriched by enticing examples from around the world, The Public History Reader illuminates how the past is made into history by many kinds of people, including professional historians but also individuals and groups determined to explore and represent their <em>own</em> histories.

It uses a sense of humor and lighthearted tone to give learners a positive, enjoyable experience of thinking in math, and an understanding of the increasingly important role that science and technology play in our lives. A four-part format presents readers with a fundamental introduction, shows how they can think about arithmetic in a new way&#x2014;based on what they already know, introduces them to truly abstract mathematics, and teaches them about the special properties of modular arithmetic that are central to modern life. For anyone who has taken an algebra class in high school, and wants to take their understanding of math a little farther&#x2014;and into everyday life.</p><p><p> <b><i>The Magic of Numbers</i></b> was written with two goals in mind: first, to introduce the reader to some of the beauty of numbers&#x2014;the patterns in their behavior that have fascinated mathematicians for millennia, and some surprising applications of those patterns; second, and equally important, to teach the reader something of the mathematical mode of thought: the feeling of exploration, excitement, and discovery that are part of how mathematics is developed. </p> <p> The book, written originally for the course Quantitative Reasoning 28 that the authors developed and taught at Harvard, draws the reader into the content through an engaging and informal writing style. Example-driven, it reduces to a minimum the abstract notation and formal argument that often creates a barrier between mathematicians and students, focusing more instead on the experimental aspect of the subject. Above all, the authors communicate to the reader a sense of the joy and fascination of learning mathematics. </p> <p> Additional exercises, problems, and sample exams are available at: <b>www.prenhall.com/gross</b> </p> <b>Principal topics include:</b> <ul> <li>Counting and basic combinatorics, with applications to probability and games</li> <li>The arithmetic of natural numbers: the Euclidean Algorithm and the unique factorization theorem</li> <li>Modular arithmetic, including Fermat's Theorem, Euler's Theorem, and how to take powers and roots</li> <li>Codes: how the special properties of ordinary and modular arithmetic in combination allow us to construct the public-key codes that help make data transmission secure.</li> </ul><p> <b><i>Benedict Gross</i></b> is the Leverett Professor of Mathematics and Dean of Harvard College. </p> <p> <b><i>Joe Harris</i></b> is the Higgins Professor of Mathematics and Chair of the Mathematics Department at Harvard. </p></p><h2>A Theory of Justice: Revised Edition (Belknap)</h2><p><p> Since it appeared in 1971, John Rawls's <i>A Theory of Justice</i> has become a classic. The author has now revised the original edition to clear up a number of difficulties he and others have found in the original book. </p><p> Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common core of the democratic tradition--justice as fairness--and to provide an alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and equal persons. "Each person," writes Rawls, "possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override." Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant, Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was when first published. </p></p><p>"Each person" writes John Rawls, "possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. Therefore in a just society the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests".<p>In this book Mr. Rawls attempts to account for these propositions, which he believes express our intuitive convictions of the primacy of justice. The principles of justice he sets forth are those that free and rational persons would accept in an initial position of equality. In this hypothetical situation, which corresponds to the state of nature in social contract theory, no one knows his or her place in society; his or her class position or social status; his or her fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities; his or her intelligence, strength, and the like; or even his or her conception of the good. Thus, deliberating behind a veil of ignorance, people determine their rights and duties. The first, theoretical, section of the book addresses objections to the theory and alternative positions, especially utilitarianism. The author then applies his theory to the philosophical basis of the constitutional liberties, the problem of distributive justice, and the definition of the ground and limits of political duty and obligation. He includes here discussion of the issues of civil disobedience and conscientious objection. Finally, he connects the theory of justice with a doctrine of the good and of moral development. This enables him to formulate a conception of society as a social union of social unions and to use the theory of justice to explain the values of community.</p><p>Since the appearance ofthe book in 1971, A Theory of Justice has been translated into 23 languages. Revisions to the original English text have been included in translations since 1975. This new English edition incorporates all those revisions, which the author considers to be significant improvements, especially to the discussions of liberty and primary goods. The Preface for the Revised Edition discusses the revisions in some detail.</p><b>John Rawls</b> was James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University. He was recipient of the 1999 National Humanities Medal.</p><h2>Living the Truth: The Truth of All Things and Reality and the Good</h2><p><p>Living the Truth includes two other Pieper books: Truth of All Things and Reality and the Good.</p> <p>This volume presents illuminating treatises of Josef Pieper on Thomistic anthropology and on the principles of right human behavior based on anthropology. </p> <p>With his customary lucidity, Pieper shows how all reality is positioned between the mind of God and the mind of man and is the basis for both man's unquenchable yearning and the measure of all man's knowledge. He then develops the Thomistic position that reality is also the basis for the good and therefore the norm of conscience and ethical action. As Pieper himself expresses in part of the thesis of the second treatise, "An insight into the nature of the good as rooted in objective being, of itself compels us to carry it out in a definite human attitude, and it makes certain attitudes impossible." </p> <p>Josef Pieper was schooled in the Greek classics and the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. He also studied philosophy, law and sociology, and has been a professor at the University of Munster, Germany. His books have been widely praised by both the secular and religious press. </p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Heart of the Humanities: Reading, Writing, Teaching</h2><p><p><b>From one of America's great professors, a collection of works exploring the importance of reading, writing, and teaching well, for anyone invested in the future of the humanities.</b></p><p> A renowned professor of English at the University of Virginia, Mark Edmundson has devoted his career to tough-minded yet optimistic advocacy for the humanities.

For the first time in the West, this book presents this ancient art and provides a method by which anyone can learn to read his own pulse. Imbalances and potential disease states can be detected in their early stages, giving one the opportunity to correct them before they affect the quality of life. With practice and guidance, one can acquire the proficiency to use this knowledge to heal self and others.</p><p>Because of the interest in Ayurveda in the hearts of both practitioners and laymen and because of the demand, I have been teaching seminars on pulse diagnosis across the United States, England and at the Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <p>In any system of medicine, pulse assessment is a matter of technical skill, subjective experience and intuition. Accuracy also depends upon the individual&#x2019;s persistent practice and quality of sensitive awareness. Several teachers, gurus and yogis in India influenced my early education in pulse reading. Even though simplified descriptions of various conditions of the pulse are found in the standard Ayurvedic texts, the methods of examination are not given in detail. However, it is possible to learn these subjective methods of pulse examination that reveal the characteristics of the individual&#x2019;s prakruti, vikruti and various doshic disorders and to verify their accuracy objectively. </p><p>The purpose of this book is to teach simplified techniques to students and to provide deep comprehensive information as well. Throughout my earlier Ayurvedic education, I also studied modern allopathic medicine and this knowledge has broadened my interpretation of pulse reading. </p><p>All of what I am sharing with you in this book may not be found in the standard Ayurvedic texts. However, all that I have included here is based upon Ayurvedic principles. I received this knowledge from my mentors in the Ayurvedic tradition and it has since unfolded in my heart through clinical observation and practice over the last 25 years. </p><p>This book will give guidelines to think about various ways of feeling, reading and gathering information through the pulse. It is quite difficult to put subjective experience into words. This is my sincere attempt to express these simple ways of feeling the pulse. I hope, dear readers, that you will love this humble effort. </p><p>Love and light, </p><p>Dr. Vasant Lad<br> Albuquerque, New Mexico<br> May 1996</p>Dr. Lad brings a wealth of classroom and practical experience to the United States.

Twenty-five years ago, when the first edition of this book was being written, it was noted that race is not a static phenomenon and that, while always a part of the social reality, specific aspects change. At that time the presence of a new immigrant group, the Vietnamese, was duly noted, and the efforts to define affirmative action were described. Today we seek to describe the growing presence of El Salvadorans and Haitians and the attempts to dismantle affirmative action. </p> <p> Specific issues may change over time, but they continue to play out against a backdrop of discrimination that is rooted in the social structure and changing population composition as influenced by immigration patterns and reproduction patterns. One unanticipated change is that the breakup of the Soviet Union and further disinterest of the major industrial powers in the political and social events in Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia has made ethnic, language, and religious divisions even more the source of antagonism between and within nations. The old ideological debates about communism and capitalism have been replaced by emotional divisions over religious dogma and cultural traditions. </p> <p> We continue to be reminded about the importance of the social construction of many aspects of racial and ethnic relations. What constitutes a race in terms of identity? What meaning does race and ethnicity have amidst the growing number of interracial marriages and marriages across cultural boundaries? Beyond the spectrum of race and ethnicity, we see the socially constructed meaning attached to all religions as members debate who is the "true" keeper of the faith. As we consider matters of gender, we see again that differences are largely the result of social constructions. And finally as we consider all groups that have been subjected to discrimination, such as the disabled, the elderly, and gays and lesbians, we see, in a similar manner, the power of labeling. The very issue of national identity is also a part of the agenda. The public and politicians alike question, "How many immigrants can we accept?" and "How much should be done to make up for past discrimination?" We are also witnessing the emergence of race, ethnicity, and national identity as global issues. </p> <p><b>Changes in the Census 2000 Update Edition</b></p> <p> This eighth edition includes the extraordinary amount of data from Census 2000. We pride ourselves on providing the most current information possible to document the patterns in intergroup relations both in the United States and abroad. </p> <p> Relevant scholarly findings in a variety of disciplines 'including economics, anthropology, and communication sciences have been incorporated since the seventh edition. The feature "Listen to Their Voices" appears in every chapter. These selections include excerpts from the writings or speeches of noted members of racial and ethnic groups such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosario Ferre, Elie Wiesel, Patricia J. Williams, and Nelson Mandela. Their writings will help students appreciate both the emotional and the intellectual energies felt by subordinate groups. </p> <p> The Census 2000 Update edition includes the following additions and changes: </p> <p> The 2000 Census and other recent data from government sources are included throughout this edition. There are 4 new figures and 3 tables. These include Figure 1.1 that presents the multiple race choice data new to this census. Elsewhere in Chapter 1 are analyses of the Census 2000 residential data showing segregation levels. New maps show where African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and Asian Americans reside. In addition 11 figures and 11 tables have been revised to reflect Census 2000 data. </p> <p> An Internet Exercise is included at the end of every chapter to offer a way to continue learning via the Web. </p> <p> The Intergroup Relations Continuum presented in Chapter 1 has been reintroduced in later chapters to provide a connection between the coverage of specific groups and the introductory material (Chapters 1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 15). </p> <p> An expansion of the discussion on racial identity to include biracial children and the debate over the "race question" to be included in Census 2000 (Chapter 1). </p> <p> The world systems theory of Immanuel Wallerstein is outlined in Chapter 1 as it applies to race and ethnicity and later reintroduced in Chapters 10 and 15. </p> <p> A look back after five years at the continuing legacy of <i>The Bell Curve</i> by Charles Murray and Richard Herrenstein (Chapter 1). </p> The definition of hate crimes and increasing efforts to tabulate their occurrence in the United States (Chapter 2). <p></p> <p> The role of race in everyday behavior is considered in a new "Listen to Their Voices" entitled "Just Walk On By" by Staples (Chapter 3). </p> <p> Sociologist William Julius Wilson offers his insight in a new "Listen to Their Voices" entitled "When Work Disappears" (Chapter 3). </p> <p> Description of environmental justice as another, but often overlooked, form of discrimination (Chapter 3). </p> <p> A new "Listen to Their Voices" entitled "Roots" by Raffi Ishkanian (Chapter 4). </p> <p> A case study of the Amish is used to introduce the impact that laws and court decisions can have on a religious ,group (Chapter 5). </p> <p> "Whiteness" as reflected in the growing consideration of white studies in academe is introduced to students in the context of ethnicity (Chapter 5). </p> <p> A new "Listen to Their Voices" entitled "When the Boats Arrived" by Diane Glancy (Chapter 5). </p> <p> Casino gambling receives special attention as a section within the consideration of economic development and tribal people in the United States (Chapter 6). </p> <p> A controversy straight out of the sports pages is addressed by Tim Giago in a new "Listen to Their Voices" entitled "Honor Another Race of People as Mascots" (Chapter 6). </p> <p> A new "Listen to Their Voices" entitled "Of Race and Risk" by Patricia J.

In addition, photographs, maps, and political cartoons have been updated. </p> <p><b>Complete Coverage in Four Parts</b></p> <p> Any constructive discussion of racial and ethnic minorities must do more than merely describe events. Part One, "Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Groups," includes the relevant theories and operational definitions that ground the study of race and ethnic relations in the social sciences. We specifically present the functionalist, conflict, and labeling theories of sociology in their relation to the study of race and ethnicity. We show the relationship between subordinate groups and the study of stratification. They will also be introduced to the dual labor market theory and the irregular economy from economics and reference group theory from psychology. The extensive treatment of prejudice and discrimination covers anti-White prejudice as well as the more familiar topic of bigotry aimed at subordinate groups. Discrimination is analyzed from an economic perspective, including the latest efforts to document discrimination in environmental issues such as location of toxic waste facilities and the move to dismantle affirmative action. </p> <p> In Part Two, "Ethnic and Religious Sources of Conflict," we examine some often-ignored sources of intergroup conflict in the United States: White ethnic groups and religious minorities. Diversity in the United States is readily apparent when we look at the ethnic and religious groups that have resulted from waves of immigration. Refugees, now primarily from Haiti and Central America, also continue to raise major issues. </p> <p> Any student needs to be familiar with the past to understand present forms of discrimination and subordination. Part Three, "Major Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups in the United States," brings into sharper focus the history and contemporary status of Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Jews in the United States. Social institutions such as family, education, politics, health care, religion, and the economy receive special attention for the subordinate groups. The author contends that institutional discrimination, rather than individual action, is the source of conflict between the subordinate and dominant elements in the United States. </p> <p> Part Four; "Other Patterns of Dominance," includes topics related to American racial and ethnic relations. The author recognizes, as have Gunnar Myrdal and Helen Mayer Hacker before, that relations between women and men resemble those between Blacks and Whites. Therefore, in this book, we consider the position of women as a subordinate group. Since the first edition of <i>Racial and Ethnic Groups,</i> published over twenty years ago, debates over equal rights and abortion have shown no sign of resolution. For women of color, we document the double jeopardy suffered because of subordinate status twice over: race and gender. </p> <p> Perhaps we can best comprehend intergroup conflict in the United States by comparing it to the ethnic hostilities in other nations. The similarities and differences between the United States and other societies treated in this book are striking. Again, as in the seventh edition, we examine the tensions in Canada, Israel, Mexico, Northern Ireland, and South Africa to document further the diversity of intergroup conflict. </p> <p> The final chapter highlights other groups that have been the subject of exclusion&#x2014;the aged, people with disabilities, and gay men and lesbians. This chapter also includes a concluding section that ties together thematically the forces of dominance-subordination that have been the subject of this book. </p> <p><b>Features to Aid Students</b></p> <p> Several features are included in the text to facilitate student learning. A "Chapter Outline" appears at the beginning of each chapter and is followed by "Highlights," a short section alerting students to important issues and topics to be addressed. To help students review, each chapter ends with a summary "Conclusion." A bibliography, "For Further Information," provides references for additional research. The "Key Terms" are highlighted in bold when they are first introduced in the text and are listed with page numbers at the conclusion of each chapter. Periodically throughout the book the Intergroup Relations Continuum first presented in Chapter 1 is repeated to reinforce major concepts while addressing the unique social circumstances of individual racial and ethnic groups. In addition there is an end-of-book "Glossary" with full definitions referenced to chapter numbers. In this edition there are both "Review Questions" and "Critical Thinking Questions." The "Review Questions" are intended to remind the reader of Viajor points while the "Critical Thinking Questions" encourage students to think more deeply about some of the major issues raised in the chapter. A new section includes an Internet Exercise that allows students to do some critical thinking via the Web. As a part of each chapter there is a section "For Further Information" that highlights recent books and presents a list of relevant journals. An "Internet Resource Directory" has been expanded to allow access to the latest electronic sources. An extensive illustration program, which includes maps and political cartoons, expands the text discussion and provokes thought. </p> <p><b>Ancillary Materials</b></p> <p> The ancillary materials that accompany this textbook have been carefully created to enhance the topics being discussed. We again offer a Student Study Guide to accompany <i>Racial and Ethnic Groups.</i> Written by Noel Barker at DePaul University, it includes learning objectives, exercises keyed to the learning objectives, suggestions for additional research, and practice tests. For the instructor, an Instructor's Manual and Test Bank, written by Jody Anderson Wetzler at Minnesota State University, Mankato, includes chapter overviews, key term identification exercises, discussion questions, topics for class discussion, audiovisual resources, and test questions in both multiple-choice and essay format. The test bank portion of the manual is available in the computerized Prentice Hall Custom Test, which allows you to create your own personalized exams. It is available in both Windows and Macintosh formats. </p> <p> In tandem with the text, students and professors can now take full advantage of the World Wide Web to enrich their study of racial and ethnic groups. The Schaefer Companion Website&#x2122; correlates the text with related material available on the Internet. Features of the Website include chapter objectives and study questions, as well as links to interesting material and information from other sites on the Web that can reinforce and enhance the content of each chapter. You can reach the site at <b>http://www.prenhall.com/schaefer</b> </p> <p> <i>Sociology on the Internet: A Prentice Hall Guide, 1999-2000</i> introduces students to the origin and innovations behind the Internet and provides clear strategies for navigating the complexity of the Internet and World Wide Web. Exercises within and at the end of the chapters allow students to practice searching for the myriad resources available to the student of sociology. This 96-page supplementary book is free to students when shrinkwrapped as a package with <i>Racial and Ethnic Groups.</i> </p> <p> Changes in race and ethnic relations will continue because these relations are a part of our constantly changing behavior. <i>Racial and Ethnic Groups</i> gives the reader a firm knowledge of the past and the present, as well as a sufficient conceptual understanding to prepare for the future. </p></p><h2>The King in the Golden Mask</h2><p>First published in French in 1892 and never before translated fully into English, <i>The King in the Golden Mask</i> gathers 21 of Marcel Schwob&#x2019;s cruelest and most erudite tales. Melding the fantastic with historical fiction, these stories describe moments of unexplained violence both historical and imaginary, often blending the two through Schwob&#x2019;s collaging of primary source documents into fiction. Brimming with murder, suicide, royal leprosy and medieval witchcraft, Schwob&#x2019;s stories portray clergymen furtively attending medieval sabbaths, Protestant galley slaves laboring under the persecution of Louis XIV and dice-tumbling sons of Florentine noblemen wandering Europe at the height of the 1374 plague. These writings are of such hallucinatory detail and linguistic specificity that the reader is left wondering whether they aren&#x2019;t newly unearthed historical documents. To read Schwob is to encounter human history in its most scintillating form as it comes into contact with this unparalleled imagination.</p><p><p>The secret influence on generations of writers, from Guillaume Apollinaire and Jorge Luis Borges to Roberto Bola�o and J. Rodolfo Wilcock, <b>Marcel Schwob</b> (1867&#x2013;1905) was as versed in the street slang of medieval thieves as he was in the poetry of Whitman (whom he translated into French). Paul Val�ry and Alfred Jarry both dedicated their first books to him, and in doing so paid tribute to the man who could evoke both the intellect of Leonardo da Vinci and the anarchy of <i>Ubu Roi</i>.</p>Schwob disbelieved in originality&#x2015;everything had been said, had been done&#x2015;but he trusted in the creative spirit. His stories both draw on historical sources and forfeit narrative by instead acknowledging that thieves, pirates, street urchins and prisoners are equally cursed to be human, and to be human is to indulge in casual cruelty. This confluence is unexpected, even jarring. Indeed, the mystery and inexplicability of the stories often result in something profoundly moving. (Tristan Foster <i>Music &amp; Literature</i>)<br><br>Kit Schluter&#x2019;s translation from the French is superb, and he provides a thoughtful afterword. (Martin Billheimer <i>Counterpunch</i>)</p><h2>A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Books (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p>The final volume in the Everyman&#x2019;s Library Charles Dickens collection: the timeless story of everyone&#x2019;s favorite misanthrope, Ebenezer Scrooge, together with four more of Dickens&#x2019;s Christmas tales and with Arthur Rackham&#x2019;s classic illustrations.<br><br>No holiday season is complete without the story of tightfisted Mr. Scrooge, of his long-suffering and mild-mannered clerk, Bob Cratchit, of Bob&#x2019;s kindhearted lame son, Tiny Tim, and of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future.<br><br>First published in 1843, <i>A Christmas Carol </i>was republished in 1852 in a new edition with four other Christmas stories&#x2014;<i>The Chimes, The Cricket on the Hearth, The Battle of Life,</i> and <i>The Haunted Man.</i> These beloved tales revived the notion of the Christmas &#x201c;spirit&#x201d;&#x2014;and have kept it alive ever since.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>The Zionist Idea: A Historical Analysis and Reader</h2><p>Writings by nineteenth and twentieth-century thinkers reveal the intellectual history of Zionism</p><p><p>rtzberg /f Arthur /r ed.</p>This 1960 "historical analysis and reader" gathers the writings of the most important Zionists of the time.

Examining hundreds of the wonderfully varied exhibitions that culminated in the Crystal Palace of 1851, this generously illustrated book sheds light on a vast and colorful expanse of English social history that has thus far remained wholly unsurveyed.</p><p>Drawing on a wealth of never-before-used information, Mr. Altick traces London exhibitions as they evolved from the display of relics in pre-Reformation churches, through the collections of eighteenth-century virtuosi, to the first science museums and public art galleries. He also narrates for the first time the history of the panorama and diorama as an influential genre of nineteenth-century popular art. At every point, the London shows are linked to the prevailing intellectual atmosphere and to trends in public taste.</p><p>The material is fresh and fascinating; the range--from freaks to popular science, from the funeral effigies at Westminster Abbey to Madame Tussaud's waxworks--impressive. Like the exhibitions that best served the Victorian ideal of mass culture, <i>The Shows of London</i> is both entertaining and informative.</p></p><p>Richard D. Altick was Regents&#x2019; Professor of English at The Ohio State University. Among his numerous works are <i>The Scholar Adventurers</i>, <i>The English Common Reader</i>, and <i>Victorian People and Ideas</i>.</p><h2>Understanding Financial Statements</h2><p><p> <b> </b>A comprehensive reference tool for those interested in understanding and interpreting financial statements through a text that prides itself in readability, concise coverage and accessibility. </p> <p> <b>KEY TOPICS</b>: Financial Statements: An Overview; The Balance Sheet; Income Statement and Statement of Stockholders&#x2019; Equity; Statement of Cash Flow; A Guide to Earnings and Financial Reporting Quality; The Analysis of Financial Statements</p> <p> <b>MARKET</b>: The text gives readers the conceptual background and analytical tools necessary to understand and interpret business financial statements</p></p><p>Easily accessible -- regardless of the student&#39;s background -- this classic text presents the conceptual background and analytical tools necessary to understand and interpret financial statements. The emphasis throughout is on the evaluation of financial statements and their usefulness for business decision-making -- rather than on how the financial statements are constructed.Preface <p> For readers of previous editions anxiously awaiting important updates, I am pleased to report that Aileen Ormiston's hair is also turning grey. My daughter Eleanor has completed three fascinating and challenging years as an analyst for Enron Corporation, and she is now heading back to graduate school for an MBA in international business. The smartest move I have ever made on this book over its many years and editions is to involve Aileen as a co-author, beginning with the fifth edition. She, however, still refers to the text as "the Fraser book," much to the dismay of her students and delight of her co-author. Uses for the Sixth Edition </p><p> Understanding Financial Statements is designed to serve a wide range of readers and purposes, which include:</p><p>Text or supplementary text for financial statement analysis courses. Supplementary text for accounting, finance, and business management classes which cover financial statement analysis. Study material for short courses on financial statements in continuing education and executive development programs. Self-study guide or course material for bank credit analysis training programs. Reference book for investors and others who make decisions based on the analysis of financial statements. Features of the Sixth Edition </p><p> In revising the text, we have paid close attention to the responses received from faculty who teach from the book, from students who take courses using the book as a primary or supplementary text, and from other readers of the book. Our primary objective remains to convey to readers the conceptual background and analytical tools necessary to understand and interpret business financial statements. Readers and reviewers of earlier editions have commented that the strengths of this book are its readability, concise coverage, and accessibility. We have attempted to retain these elements in the sixth edition. </p><p> The sixth edition incorporates the many new requirements and changes in accounting reporting and standards.</p><p>The financial statements of R.E.C. Inc. have been updated to include the following changes in Appendix B: "The Analysis of Segmental Data," has been rewritten to reflect the new segment standard implemented by the FASB since the last edition. As a result of the many changes that impacted chapter 3, the minicases have been updated. Three new problems have been added to each chapter and are identified with icons to indicate the problem type: writing skills problems, internet problems', and PETsMART problems 5. The writing skills problems have been added as a result of the emphasis employers place on communication skills. The Internet problems allow the student to explore a variety of Web sites on the Internet. The PETsMART problems offer the opportunity to the student to analyze a real company throughout the use of the text. Information for the PETsMART problems, as well as some of the Internet problems is available on the Prentice Hall Web site: prenhall/fraser. The footnotes provided through the text contain resources that may be used by instructors to form the basis of a reading list for students. The sixth edition includes other features of earlier editions that readers have found useful: appendixes on earnings quality, the analysis of segmental data and understanding bank financial statements; self-tests at the ends of chapters, with solutions provided; chapter-end study questions and problems; minicases using real company information, and a glossary of key terms used in the text. The Instructor's Manual, which is available as a supplement, contains solutions to study questions, problems, and minicases; a sample course project with assignment outline and resources. New to the sixth edition Instructor's Manual is a test bank for chapters 1 through 5. Both objective and short-answer test questions are included. A Web site for the text has been created as mentioned above. Power point slides can be downloaded for use in class from this site. </p><p> We hope that readers will continue to find material in Understanding Financial Statements accessible, relevant, and useful.</p><p>Lyn M.

Knopf): Immediately following the revolutionary discovery of the structure of DNA by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, the world of molecular biology was caught up in a gold rush. The goal: to uncover the secrets of life that the newly elucidated molecule promised to reveal. Genes, Girls, and Gamow is James Watson's report on the amazing aftermath of the DNA breakthrough, picking up where his now classic memoir, The Double Helix, leaves off.<br><br>Here are the collaborations and collisions of giants, not only Watson and Crick themselves, but also legions of others, including Linus Pauling (the greatest chemist of the day), Richard Feynman (the bongoplaying cynosure of Caltech), and especially George Gamow, the bearlike, whiskeywielding Russian physicist, who had turned his formidable intellect to the field of genetics; with Gamowan irrepressible prankster to bootWatson would found the legendary RNA Tie Club.<br><br>But Watsonat twentyfive already the winner of genetic research's greatest jackpotis obsessed with another goal as well: to find love, and a wife equal to his unexpected fame. As he and an international cast of roguish young colleagues do important research they also compare notes and share complaints on the scarcity of eligible mates. And amid the feverish search for the role of the then still mysterious RNA molecule, Watson's thoughts are seldom far from the supreme object of his desire, an enthralling Swarthmore coed who also happens to be the daughter of Harvard's most eminent biologist.<br><br>Part scientific apprenticeship, part sentimental education, Genes, Girls, and Gamow is a penetrating revelation of how great science is accomplished. It is also a charmingly candid account of one young man's full range of ambitions.<br></p><p>Readers unfamiliar with James D. Watson's previous memoir, <i>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</i>, may be surprised that his new one pays as much attention to his pursuit of the perfect woman as to the pursuit of knowledge. But Watson's 1968 book wasn't a bestseller because of its scientific material (though it was lucidly written for the general public); it was his candid portrait of professional rivalries, consuming ambition, and personal eccentricities that made it both popular and controversial. Even today, Watson's lively prose and decidedly frank opinions are still far from the norm. Oh sure, <i>Girls, Genes, and Gamow</i> contains plenty of information about his efforts (with colleagues ranging from bongo-playing Richard Feynman to the free-spirited George Gamow) to unravel the complexities of the RNA molecule from 1953 to '56. But Watson--still in his 20s at the time--also devotes pages to hard drinking, bitter marital breakups, and unwanted pregnancies among his not-so-high-minded peers, and his own anguished affair with a Swarthmore undergrad who left him for a German engineering student. It's not every Nobel Prize-winning biologist who would admit he was thrilled to have his photo in <i>Vogue</i> because it would "make 'with it' American girls more eager to know me," but that boyish openness gives Watson's book its charm. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>hase for the double-helical structure of DNA was an adventure story in the best sense. First, there was a pot of scientific gold to be found&#x2014;possibly very soon. Second, among the explorers who raced to find it, there was much bravado, unexpected lapses of reason, and painful acceptances of the fates not going well. The early 1950s were not times to be cautious but rather to run fast whenever a path opened up&#x2014;nuggets of gold might be lying exposed over the next hill. As one of the winners with a fortune much, much bigger than I ever dared hope for, I could not stop moving. There was more genetic loot to be located, and not joining in the further hunt would make me feel old.&#x201d; &#x2014;from the preface<br><br>Immediately following the revolutionary discovery of the structure of DNA by James D.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>Once in a while, a publication comes along that on first sight seems oddly out of place but on second viewing is admirably suited to its purpose. This little series of biographical summaries of the thoughts of 24 Western philosophers from Democritus to Derrida is admirable not only for its reasonable price but even more for the intelligence and clarity of the writing. Each volume has been prepared by an expert in the subject, and the result is a series of well-drawn and exceptionally useful pocket-size (4.5 x 7 inches) sketches of major figures in the history of Western thought. The level is such that no special background in philosophy is required to understand the concepts discussed. Each volume also contains a short bibliography, some of which refer to electronic journals or web sites. Most of the individuals chosen for the series come as no surprise, e.g., Descartes, Hegel, Kant, Nietzsche, Locke, Hume, Plato, and Socrates. But there are a few unexpected choices, like Alan Turing and Karl PopperAalthough on further consideration, they make more sense. Turing's influence on mathematics and on the development of computers has long been recognized, but his 1936 paper "On Compatible Numbers," which appeared in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1936-37, influenced studies in the philosophy of mind. Popper's development of the concept of "historicism" in such works as The Open Society and Its Enemies and The Poverty of Historicism significantly influenced 20th-century political thought. Ultimately, this set should be in every academic and public library as well as many school libraries.ATerry C. Skeats, Bishop's Univ.

One of Dickens's most popular novels, <i>Great Expectations</i> follows the orphaned Pip as he grows from poverty into a gentleman, becoming entangled with the strange Miss Havisham and her beautiful but coldhearted ward, Estella, and coming into a fortune from an unknown benefactor. This engrossing work, which recently celebrated its 150th birthday, remains one of Dickens's best.</p><p>Dickens considered <i>Great Expectations</i> one of his "little pieces," and indeed, it <i>is</i> slim compared to such weighty novels as <i>David Copperfield</i> or <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. But what this cautionary tale of a young man raised high above his station by a mysterious benefactor lacks in length, it more than makes up for in its remarkable characters and compelling story. The novel begins with young orphaned Philip Pirrip--Pip--running afoul of an escaped convict in a cemetery. This terrifying personage bullies Pip into stealing food and a file for him, threatening that if he tells a soul "your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted and ate." The boy does as he's asked, but the convict is captured anyway, and transported to the penal colonies in Australia. Having started his novel in a cemetery, Dickens then ups the stakes and introduces his hero into the decaying household of Miss Havisham, a wealthy, half-mad woman who was jilted on her wedding day many years before and has never recovered. Pip is brought there to play with Miss Havisham's ward, Estella, a little girl who delights in tormenting Pip about his rough hands and future as a blacksmith's apprentice. <blockquote> I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it. </blockquote> It is an infection that Pip never quite recovers from; as he spends more time with Miss Havisham and the tantalizing Estella, he becomes more and more discontented with his guardian, the kindhearted blacksmith, Joe, and his childhood friend Biddy. When, after several years, Pip becomes the heir of an unknown benefactor, he leaps at the chance to leave his home and friends behind to go to London and become a gentleman. But having expectations, as Pip soon learns, is a two-edged sword, and nothing is as he thought it would be. Like that other "little piece," <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, <i>Great Expectations</i> is different from the usual Dickensian fare: the story is dark, almost surreal at times, and you'll find few of the author's patented comic characters and no comic set pieces. And yet this is arguably the most compelling of Dickens's novels for, unlike David Copperfield or Martin Chuzzlewit, the reader can never be sure that things <i>will</i> work out for Pip. Even Dickens apparently had his doubts--he wrote two endings for this novel. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>The first book edition of Great Expectations was published in three volumes in 1861. It is now reissued simultaneously with the serialised version of 1860-1 and a newly photographed colour reproduction of the original manuscript, enabling scholars and enthusiasts to study the book version alongside the work-in-progress.</p><h2>Political Geography</h2><p>This is a comprehensive survey of the field of political geography, but it goes far beyond traditional topics.

The second edition of his compelling account has been thoroughly revised and updated with further contemporary developments, and also includes an expanded discussion of the relationship between race and health as well as new material on health care reform and social policy.</p> This engaging text will be indispensable reading for all students and scholars of medical sociology, especially those with the courage to confront the possibility that society really does make people sick.</p><p><p>William C.

The contributors also consider the fundamentals of the mutual aid process, the institutional benefits of group service, and specific clinical examples of mutual aid groups.

I have grown up but I feel like I&#x2019;m moving backward. And I can&#x2019;t do anything about it.</i>&#x201d; &#x2013;Esperanza<br><br> Over two million of the nation&#x2019;s eleven million undocumented immigrants have lived in the United States since childhood. Due to a broken immigration system, they grow up to uncertain futures. In <i>Lives in Limbo,</i> Roberto G. Gonzales introduces us to two groups: the college-goers, like Ricardo, who had good grades and a strong network of community support that propelled him to college and DREAM Act organizing but still landed in a factory job a few short years after graduation, and the early-exiters, like Gabriel, who failed to make meaningful connections in high school and started navigating dead-end jobs, immigration checkpoints, and a world narrowly circumscribed by legal limitations. This vivid ethnography explores why highly educated undocumented youth share similar work and life outcomes with their less-educated peers, despite the fact that higher education is touted as the path to integration and success in America. Mining the results of an extraordinary twelve-year study that followed 150 undocumented young adults in Los Angeles, <i>Lives in Limbo </i>exposes the failures of a system that integrates children into K-12 schools but ultimately denies them the rewards of their labor.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>"Superb. . . . An important examination of the devastating consequences of 'illegality' on our young people."&#x2014;Junot D�az, author of&nbsp;<i>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>This is How You Lose Her</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Lives in Limbo</i> is a book of tragic beauty. It recounts with moral clarity, conceptual precision, and empirical rigor what Hannah Arendt, writing in another terrible time, called 'the calamity of the right-less.' It is about what happens in a society, our society, when children and youth who are de facto but not de jure members of the family of the nation lose the right to have rights. It fearlessly narrates the quotidian empire of suffering and shattered dreams our barbaric immigration system has begotten. Reading it will bring tears and joy. It will make you mad and it will make you sad. It will stand as the definitive study of the undocumented coming of age in our midst. It is a book every teacher, every policymaker, indeed every concerned citizen should read and ponder."&#x2014;Marcelo M. Su�rez-Orozco, coeditor of<i>&nbsp;Latinos: Remaking America</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Roberto G. Gonzales offers a masterful portrait of the 2.1 million undocumented migrants who arrived as children and grew up in the United States.&nbsp;<i>Lives in Limbo</i>&nbsp;chronicles the heartbreak and anguish they experience as they slowly come to realize there is no secure place for them in the only country they know. The compassionate telling of their stories represents qualitative social science at its finest and underscores the urgency of finding a humane solution to their plight."&#x2014;Douglas S. Massey, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Brokered Boundaries: Creating Immigrant Identity in Anti-Immigrant Times<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Lives in Limbo</i>&nbsp;</i>is one of the most important books in immigration studies of the past decade.

Through his careful attention to the ways in which these young people navigate these contradictory processes,&nbsp;Roberto G. Gonzales puts a human face on the many victims of America&#x2019;s broken immigration system. Theoretically rich, beautifully written, and cogently argued, this brilliant book is a landmark study of the human costs of American policy failures.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mary C. Waters, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Inheriting the City: The Children of Immigrants Come of Age<br> &nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;This necessary book documents in tragic detail how&nbsp;American public policies prevent hardworking children from pursuing their lives as full members of the society in which they were raised. The scholarly and personal commitment required to produce a work of this caliber is evident in the intimacy of the ethnographic work. This theoretically skillful book is one of the best examples of high-quality academic scholarship that also fully engages the policy debates of our times. An impressive achievement that will set the standard for others.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert C. Smith, author of&nbsp;<i>Mexican New York: Transnational Worlds of New Immigrants</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Written after years of fieldwork, this book brings into sharp focus the plight of undocumented children transitioning&nbsp;to adulthood in America. Lack of a path to citizenship condemns hundreds of thousands of these youths to a life&nbsp;of permanent marginality. This is must reading for anyone wishing to understand the realities of contemporary&nbsp;immigration."&#x2014;Alejandro Portes, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Immigrant America&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "This extraordinary study provides important details about a generation of immigrants that, through the courageous organizing and leadership of its members, has already permanently altered the national debate on immigration reform, politically united the Mexican American community across all generations of presence in the United States, and launched the most vibrant youth movement this country has seen in four decades. The book powerfully demonstrates the national shame in failing to enact, nearly a decade and a half after its first introduction, the congressional legislation that would permit the United States to benefit fully from the intellect, ingenuity, and perseverance of this generation of young immigrants."&#x2014;Thomas A. Saenz, President and General Counsel, MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund)<br> &nbsp;<br> "This book accomplishes something truly remarkable.

Of course, it has done nothing of the kind, but it does enable the historian today to approach that past in a more critical spirit and to attempt a deeper and more detached analysis than could have been expected a generation ago. The purpose of this work is therefore not merely to recount but to explain the course of English overseas expansion and the beginning of the overseas empire; a prolonged pregnancy, culminating in a difficult birth and sickly infancy. The introductory essay discusses the forces and motives involved in the expansion movement, which is seen as being part of a wider European movement and derivative in many ways from it. The author considers the attitude and conduct of the Tudors and early Stuarts towards this fundamentally commercial movement and examines the nature and importance of sea power, the contribution of different social groups, and the relevance of religious and economic ideals as well as nationalistic sentiment. These various themes are taken up again in the narrative chapters which follow, dealing with the enterprises of exploration, trade, plunder and colonisation successively through from the early Bristol quest for &#39;Brasil&#39; to the diverse ventures of the 1620s.</p><p>Traces the maritime expansion of England through descriptions of a multitude of sea voyages from 1480 through 1630.

Sometimes, when I'm afloat in sleep, like a drowned sailor, he swims towards me--a nightmare all in white, jaws gaping, and I wake up screaming and salt-water wet with sweat. Somewhere out there in the bottomless oceans lives Moby Dick, a great white winter of a whale, and I shiver still at the thought of him."<br> In vivid and compelling language, the award-winning author Geraldine McCaughrean retells Herman Melville's classic story of the obsessed Captain Ahab and his relentless hunt for the great white whale, Moby Dick. Together with Starbuck, the mate; Queequeg, the harpoonist; the sinister crewman Fedallah; and the innocent narrator, Ishmael, Ahab travels the oceans of the world in pursuit of the elusive monster, braving waves like strips of volcanoes and lightning like the visitation of angels.<br> McCaughrean's text is beautifully complemented by Victor Ambrus's evocative pictures of ships and the sea and of the white monster, Moby Dick, a creature as vast and dangerous as the sea itself. Children and young adults will be thrilled and captivated by this wonderful adventure tale.</p><p><br><strong>Geraldine McCaughrean</strong> is the author of <em>The Odyssey</em> and other titles in the acclaimed Oxford Illustrated Classics series.<br>From the team behind the adaptation of The Odyssey (1995), an audacious retelling that follows the main story line of Melville's monumental work--of Ishmael's tale of Captain Ahab's mad quest for revenge against the giant white whale that took his leg on a previous voyage. While rewrites for children of classic adult literature remain controversial, this one is stunning. The language, through which McCaughrean subtly brings out many of the metaphors of the original text, is unusually ornate for the format, making it--despite its storybook-look--more appropriate for readers beyond picture books. Although sometimes humorless, the lush prose rockets the story along like a square rigger under full sail, with all the beauty and complexity that entails. Ambrus's ample illustrations are full of character. McCaughrean largely succeeds in conveying to young readers the mood, language, story, and power of the original. For those disposed to retellings of the classics, this is a prime example of the way to do it. (Fiction. 8-12) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Faith has been taken to be the fundamental Christian virtue, the indispensable prerequisite for hope, charity, and good works. In this book, a leading Roman Catholic theologian provides an overview of the massive classical and contemporary literature on faith, and presents his own systematic theology of this essential factor of Christian life. In the first part of the book, Avery Dulles considers the biblical foundations of the theology of faith, and examines in detail the history of theological reflection on the subject, from the fathers of the early church through such modern thinkers as Tillich, Barth, Rahner, and Lonergan. The second part offers Dulles&#39;s own systematic synthesis, exploring such topics as the nature and object of faith; the birth, growth, and loss of faith; and faith and salvation. A major contribution by one of America&#39;s foremost contemporary theologians, this book will be of great interest to an ecumenical cross-section of Christian scholars and students of theology.</p><p>Faith, since the earliest Christian theologians, has been regarded as the fundamental Christian virtue--the prerequisite for hope, charity, and good works.

Their obsession with the power of certain numbers&#x2015;including 137, which describes the atom&#x2019;s fine-structure constant and has great Kabbalistic significance&#x2015;led them to develop an unlikely friendship and to embark on a joint mystical quest reaching deep into medieval alchemy, dream interpretation, and the Chinese Book of Changes. <em>137</em> explores the profound intersection of modern science with the occult, but above all it is the tale of an extraordinary, fruitful friendship between two of the greatest thinkers of our times. Originally published in hardcover as <em>Deciphering the Cosmic Number</em>. 66 b/w illustrations</p><p>Arthur I. Miller is a professor emeritus at University College London. He has published many critically acclaimed books, including Einstein, Picasso; Empire of the Stars; and 137. He lives in London.The heart of this book lies not in the promised decipherment of the title but in Miller&#x2019;s excellent dual biography of two men who changed their fields. Physicist Pauli was a brilliant but unhappy womanizer when his life&#x2019;s disturbances led him to consult with Jung, famous for connecting psychology with spirituality. The relationship was a fruitful one on both sides, with Pauli making peace with his unsettled soul and continuing his groundbreaking theorizing, while Jung gained understanding of principles of contemporary physics that led, albeit circuitously, to his articulation of the idea of synchronicity, which he felt was one of his most important contributions. A series of Pauli&#x2019;s vivid dreams, together with Jung&#x2019;s analysis of them, forms an unexpectedly rich centerpiece of the book. And the cosmic number? A bit of bait-and-switch, that, as it is only briefly mentioned. But a worthy book, nonetheless.</p><h2>Money, Greed, and God 10th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><p>A prominent scholar reveals the surprising ways that capitalism is actually the best way to follow Jesus&#x2019;s mandates to alleviate poverty and protect our earth.<br><br>Christianity generally sees capitalism as either bad because it causes much of the world&#x2019;s suffering, or good because God wants you to prosper and be rich. But there is a large, growing audience of evangelical and mainline Christians who are deeply uneasy about how to follow Jesus&#x2019;s mandate to care for the poor and the environment while living with the excesses of capitalism.</p><p></p><p>Now, a noted Christian scholar argues that there is a middle view that reveals Christianity cannot only accommodate capitalism, but Christian theology can help explain why capitalism works. By highlighting the most common myths committed by Christians when thinking about economics, such as &#x201c;capitalism is based on greed and over consumption&#x201d; or &#x201c;if someone becomes rich that automatically means someone else will become poor,&#x201d; Money, Guilt, and God equips readers to take practical steps in their own lives to conduct business, worship God, and serve others without falling into the &#x201c;prosperity gospel&#x201d; trap.</p></p><p><p>Jay W.

The first half concentrates on the structures of religious belief and practice in the period 900-1050; the second half concentrates on the revolutionary changes associated with the rise of the papacy to a new level of rulership. It shows how far one can talk of a &#34;reform movement,&#34; and how the idea and ideal of papal monarchy became both the prisoner and the leader of those who sought for a renewal of Christian life. Tellenbach&#39;s survey is the work of a scholar who has been working in the field for over sixty years. It is characterized by the freshness and maturity of its judgments, which cut through many fashionable theories. No other work on this topic offers comparable range, depth and authority.</p><p>A comprehensive survey of the history of the Church concentrates on the structure of religious belief and practice, from around 900-1125, as well as on the revolutionary changes associated with the rise of the papacy.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Mathematica Bundle: The Mathematica Programmer II</h2><p>This book is a second volume to follow <b>The Mathematica Programmer</b> (Academic Press, 1993) and is compatible with the latest release of Mathematica, version 3.0.

The child who awaits them at the tiny Bright River train station is not the strapping young boy they'd imagined--someone to help Matthew work the fields of their small farm--but rather a freckle-faced, redheaded girl named Anne (with an <i>e</i>, if you please).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew and Marilla may not be sure about Anne, but Anne takes one look at Prince Edward Island's red clay roads and the Cuthberts' snug white farmhouse with its distinctive green gables and decides that she's home at last. But will she be able to convince Marilla and Matthew to let her stay?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with only a battered carpetbag and a boundless imagination, Anne charms her way into the Cuthberts' hearts--and into the hearts of readers as well. She truly is, in the words of Mark Twain, "the dearest and most lovable child in fiction since the immortal Alice."</p></p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

Conventional wisdom suggests that a key reason is because female candidates start out at a disadvantage with the public, compared to male candidates, and then face higher standards for their behavior and qualifications as they campaign. <i>He Runs, She Runs</i> is the first comprehensive study of these dynamics and demonstrates that the conventional wisdom is wrong.</p><br><p> With rich contextual background and a wealth of findings, Deborah Jordan Brooks examines whether various behaviors--such as crying, acting tough, displays of anger, or knowledge gaffes--by male and female political candidates are regarded differently by the public. Refuting the idea of double standards in campaigns, Brooks's overall analysis indicates that female candidates do not get penalized disproportionately for various behaviors, nor do they face any double bind regarding femininity and toughness. Brooks also reveals that before campaigning begins, women do not start out at a disadvantage due to gender stereotypes. In fact, Brooks shows that people only make gendered assumptions about candidates who are new to politics, and those stereotypes benefit, rather than hurt, women candidates.</p><br><p> Proving that it is no more challenging for female political candidates today to win over the public than it is for their male counterparts, <i>He Runs, She Runs</i> makes clear that we need to look beyond public attitudes to understand why more women are not in office.</p></p><p><p>"This fascinating book debunks the most commonly offered explanation for why progress toward gender parity in elected representation has stalled. Surprisingly, Brooks finds that male and female politicians are subject to similar expectations from voters, suggesting that our widespread belief in a double standard is an impediment to encouraging more women to run for office. Good news seldom makes headlines, but Brooks' findings need to be widely disseminated."<b>--Diana Mutz, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"This is one of the most important books about gender and politics written in the last twenty-five years. It challenges what we know and is sure to influence how we think about gender. <i>He Runs, She Runs</i> is required reading for anyone interested in the role of women in the workings of democracy."<b>--James Druckman, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"<i>He Runs, She Runs</i> is a provocative analysis of gender stereotypes in U.S. campaigns. With original experimental data, Brooks sheds light on when stereotypes do and don't matter. This engaging book provides important insights into gender and candidacy, and is a valuable contribution to the field."<b>--Kira Sanbonmatsu, Rutgers University</b></p><p>"It seems almost a given that women face a range of disadvantages as political candidates. In this book, Brooks does a masterful job setting up the conventional wisdom before showing that the conventional wisdom is wrong.

This highly practical volume elucidates the defining characteristics of 14 contemporary models, including their history, views of change, views of family and the role of the therapist; and methods of assessing family dynamics, goal setting; facilitating change; and knowing when to terminate. Each chapter also includes a template for implementing therapy models, and realistic case studies-many drawn from actual practice-to illustrate how each model would address common issues.</p> <p>In addition, the volume includes extensive interviews with master therapists such as Albert Ellis, Insoo Kim Berg, Sue Johnson, Susan McDaniel, Derald Wing Sue, and many others. They share their ideas of the ways in which change occurs, how they set goals, and how they perform therapy. For further clarification, each therapist illustrates how he/she would proceed via the same case study. Learning how to perform effective family therapy can be an arduous process of trial and error, yet this resource will ease the way for students and currently practicing family therapists who need to revisit the basics. </p> <p><b>Modalities Included</b> </p><p> Bowen Family Systems Theory<br> Contextual Family Therapy<br> Cognitive Behavioral Family Therapy Models<br> Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy<br> Symbolic-Experiential Family Therapy<br> Satir Human Validation Process Model<br> Milan Systemic Family Therapy<br> Structural Family Therapy<br> Strategic Family Therapy<br> Solution-Focused Brief Therapy with Families<br> Narrative Therapy with Families<br> Emotionally Focused Therapy<br> Medical Family Therapy<br> Family Psychoeducation<br> </p> <p><b>Key Features:</b></p> <p></p><ul> <li>Introduces the theory, history, theoretical assumptions, techniques, and components of each model </li><li>Includes a template for using each model, from the initial meeting through assessment, intervention, and termination </li><li>Provides numerous interviews with master therapists </li><li>Includes case study commentary and analysis by master therapists </li><li>Suggests questions, therapeutic strategies, and/or comments to consider for each therapeutic phase </li><li>Includes a personality inventory to help readers select the most effective modality </li></ul><p></p></p><p>100<p><b>Linda Metcalf, PhD, LPC-S, LMFT-S</b>, is a professor and director, Graduate Counseling Program, Texas Wesleyan University.

It is the most accessible and complete one-volume resource available for information on the concepts, beliefs, and practices of historical and contemporary Jewish religious practice.<br> The combined effort of Israeli, American, and European scholars, this dictionary reflects the great variety of Jewish religious expression, from the traditional approaches to such recent variations as Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist Judaism. It covers all aspects of Jewish practice, law, and theology as expressed in the Bible and the Talmud and by philosophers throughout history. The work also includes biographical sketches of important personalities associated with the development of the Jewish religion over the centuries, articles on the mystical tradition and folklore, and entries addressing the more recent religious issues posed by the existence of the State of Israel.<br> Whether brief definitions, historical sketches, or explanatory essays, all entries in the dictionary are clearly and concisely written. All Hebrew words and phrases are defined for students and general readers. Numerous cross- references within the text are designed to lead users to entries on related subjects, and useful bibliographies are provided as aids to further reading and research. Offering comprehensive coverage in an easy-to-use format, <em>The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion</em> is the ideal introduction to the Jewish religion and an indispensable resource for students, scholars, and general readers.</p><p>R.J.Z. Werblowsky and Geoffrey Wigoder are both at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Intended to be a reference source for those with an interest in the Jewish religion, this volume is designed as a companion to <i>The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</i> (3d ed., Oxford, 1997). The editors also worked on the out-of-print<i> Encyclopedia of Jewish Religion,</i> which was the basis for this expanded work. Subjects and people are included because of their religious significance, and not their cultural or historical impact on Judaism. All entries are written from a religious perspective, including those on subjects such as divorce and homicide. Even for topics such as the Holocaust and Israel, the emphasis is on religious rather than historical or political aspects.

The modern nation of Israel is entered under <i>Israel, State of, Jewish Religious Life In </i>and <i>Israel, State of</i> <i>Theological Aspects</i>.<p>Articles, which vary in length from one paragraph to a full page, are arranged alphabetically. Signed articles indicate those newly written for this volume; most of the unsigned articles were retained from <i>Encyclopedia of Jewish Religion.</i> Entry titles are either English or transliterations. English terms are used when they accurately reflect a Hebrew term and would be more accessible to the user. Transliterated titles are followed by Hebrew and English translations.

Shunning the standard Aristotelian approach that treats ethos, pathos, and logos as modes of appeal, M. Jimmie Killingsworth uses common, accessible language to explain the concept of the rhetorical appeal&#x2014; meaning the use of language to plead and to please. The result is a practical and innovative guide to understanding how persuasion works that is suitable for graduate and undergraduate courses yet still addresses topics of current interest to specialists.&nbsp;<br>Supplementing the volume are practical and theoretical approaches to the construction and analysis of rhetorical messages and brief and readable examples from popular culture, academic discourse, politics, and the verbal arts. Killingsworth draws on close readings of primary texts in the field, referencing theorists to clarify concepts, while he decodes many of the basic theoretical constructs common to an understanding of identification. Beginning with examples of the model of appeals in social criticism, popular film, and advertising, he covers in subsequent chapters appeals to time, place, the body, gender, and race. Additional chapters cover the use of common tropes and rhetorical narrative, and each chapter begins with definitions of key concepts.<br><br></p><p><p><b>M.

Whether these tragic deaths could have been avoided is still debatable, but what seems clear is that the events in Texas have broad implications for religious freedom in America.<br><br>James Tabor and Eugene Gallagher's bold examination of the Waco story offers the first balanced account of the siege. They try to understand what really happened in Waco: What brought the Branch Davidians to Mount Carmel? Why did the government attack? How did the media affect events? The authors address the accusations of illegal weapons possession, strange sexual practices, and child abuse that were made against David Koresh and his followers. Without attempting to excuse such actions, they point out that the public has not heard the complete story and that many media reports were distorted.<br><br>The authors have carefully studied the Davidian movement, analyzing the theology and biblical interpretation that were so central to the group's functioning. They also consider how two decades of intense activity against so-called cults have influenced public perceptions of unorthodox religions.<br><br>In exploring our fear of unconventional religious groups and how such fear curtails our ability to tolerate religious differences, <i>Why Waco?</i> is an unsettling wake-up call. Using the events at Mount Carmel as a cautionary tale, the authors challenge all Americans, including government officials and media representatives, to closely examine our national commitment to religious freedom.</p><p>"The label "cult" can become a license to kill. . . . A courageous religious scholar, James Tabor, understanding what was at stake, tried valiantly to prevent the tragedy at Waco. Persevering in its wake, he and Eugene Gallagher thoroughly investigated the background, participants, and events leading to the destruction of the Mount Carmel Church and its members. Their findings are presented in this critically important book."&#x2015;Ramsey Clark, former Attorney General<br><br>"Here, at last, is a glimpse of 'the other side' of the tragic confrontation. . . .

His concept of &#x201c;themata,&#x201d; induced from case studies with special attention to the work of Einstein, has become one of the chief tools for understanding scientific progress. It is now one of the main approaches in the study of the initiation and acceptance of individual scientific insights.</p><p>Three principal consequences of this perspective extend beyond the study of the history of science itself. It provides philosophers of science with the kind of raw material on which some of the best work in their field is based. It helps intellectual historians to redefine the place of modern science in contemporary culture by identifying influences on the scientific imagination. And it prompts educators to reexamine the conventional concepts of education in science.</p><p>In this new edition, Holton has masterfully reshaped the contents and widened the coverage. Significant new material has been added, including a penetrating account of the advent of quantum physics in the United States, and a broad consideration of the integrity of science, as exemplified in the work of Niels Bohr. In addition, a revised introduction and a new postscript provide an updated perspective on the role of themata. The result of this thoroughgoing revision is an indispensable volume for scholars and students of scientific thought and intellectual history.</p></p><p>Gerald Holton is Mallinckrodt Research Professor of Physics, and Research Professor of History of Science, Harvard University.&#x201c;Fascinating and thought-provoking...written for the most part in a language accessible to scientist and historian alike.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Laura Tilling</b><b>, </b><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[This book] deserves to have a permanent influence on the work of historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science, as well as on educationists and intellectual historians, but it can also be recommended to the general reader.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen Toulmin</b><b>, </b><b><i>Physics Today</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant, fascinating study of how some of the fundamental ideas of modern physics were conceived and developed...

After their attempts to penetrate the Ghetto had failed, they decided to spare themselves casualties by destroying it from outside with cannon and aerial bombings. A few days later the Ghetto was totally destroyed. . . . The 'streets' were nothing but rows of smoldering ruins. It was hard to cross them without stepping on charred bodies."&#x2014;Kazik<br><br> When the Nazis decided to liquidate the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943, five hundred young Jewish fighters within the Ghetto rose up to defy them. With no weapons, no influence, and no experience in warfare, they managed to resist the Germans for almost a month. In the end, when the battle was lost, the surviving Jews were led out of the ruins through the sewers by a nineteen-year-old fighter known as Kazik. As head courier of the Jewish Fighting Organization (ZOB), which had planned and executed the uprising, Kazik spent the rest of the war helping to care for the several thousand Jews who still remained in Warsaw. This book&#x2014;an extraordinary story of courage and perseverance&#x2014;is Kazik's wartime memoir.<br><br> In stark, spare detail, Kazik reports on the efforts to prepare for the defense of the Warsaw Ghetto, the calamitous battle with the Germans, and the rescue of the few Jews who were still alive after the Ghetto was destroyed. He describes how he assumed a false Aryan identity in order to pass through the city as he collected money and found hiding places for the survivors. Constantly on guard, fearful of informers, his life always in danger, he nevertheless plotted resourcefully to aid his fellow Jews. He tells how he joined the Poles during their ill-fated uprising against the Nazis in Warsaw in 1944, had further brushes with death assisting the Polish underground, and returned to Warsaw to watch its liberation by the Russian army.<br><br> Suspenseful, moving, and remarkably heroic, Kazik's memoir is only the second source to be published on the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. It will help demolish the image of Jews as submissive victims in the Holocaust.</p><p>"A moving record of the greatest heroism and a chronicle of humanity's darkest hour." &#x2014;Adam Le Bor, The Times (London) "This memoir is the most gripping account of wartime guerilla survival against all the odds that I have ever read.

It is a portrait of a young man, who is both representative and victim of the social values which led Edwardian society into war. Jacob's life is traced from the time he is a small boy playing on the beach, through his years in Cambridge, then in artistic London, and finally making a trip to Greece, but this is no orthodox Bildungsroman. Jacob is presented in glimpses, in fragments, as Woolf breaks down traditional ways of representing character and experience.<br><br>The novel's composition coincided with the consolidation of Woolf's interest in feminism, and she criticizes the privilege thoughtless smugness of patriarchy, "the other side," "the men in clubs and Cabinets." Her stylistic innovations are conscious attempts to realize and develop women's writing and the novel dramatizes her interest in the ways both language and social environments shape differently the lives of men and women.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>First published in 1922, Jacobs Room was Virginia Woolfs third novel and the first in her more experimental mode. Set in the years leading up to the First World War, the work is an elegy, not just for an individual character, but for a generation lost in and affected by the war.This Shakespeare Head Press edition restores the text to its original form, notably recreating the space breaks on the page with which Woolf deliberately fragmented her narrative. The editor provides an extensive introduction, discussing the genesis of the novel, its biographical elements, the process of composition and revision, and the history of its early critical reception. A series of notes helps the reader to identify references and allusions, from sponge-bag trousers and gold beaters skin to Tonks and Steer, and the Hampstead Garden Suburbs; while an appendix lists variants between the first UK and first US editions of the work.Virginia Woolf's first original and distinguished work, <i>Jacob's Room</i> is the story of a sensitive young man named Jacob Flanders. The life story, character and friends of Jacob are presented in a series for separate scenes and moments from his childhood, through college at Cambridge, love affairs in London, and travels in Greece, to his death in the war. <i>Jacob's Room</i> established Virginia Woolf's reputation as a highly poetic and symbolic writer who places emphasis not on plot or action but on the psychological realm of occupied by her characters.</p><h2>The Bedford Handbook</h2><p><p>PACKAGE THIS TITLE WITH OUR 2016 MLA SUPPLEMENT, Documenting Sources in MLA Style (package ISBN-13: 9781319085476).

At first glance, Mugler's designs seem like a 1970s version of space age, with lots of pointy spears, big shoulders, and gravity-defying basques, all executed in his shimmering, "classic" materials--vinyl and leather. But the real influence is late 1920s and '30s Hollywood, the days when Edith Head and Adrian were designing gowns for Joan Crawford, Gloria Swanson, and Jean Harlow. And it's these outsize personalities who are the key to Mugler: his ideal woman is a dominatrix-cum-star; fashion for him is a "very demanding mistress." So he fills his runways with character supermodels (Jerry, Eva, Naomi, Cindy) and an eclectic mix of stars (Cyd Charisse, Diana Ross, Sharon Stone, Ivana, Tippi Hedren)--in Mugler's words, "personalities who know and accept who they are and fashion themselves accordingly." <p> This beautifully designed book brings together more than 250 photographs--some by the man himself, others by stars in their own right (Helmut Newton, David LaChapelle)--from his diverse ventures: the first public fashion show, George Michael's "Too Funky" video, <i>Macbeth</i> for the Com�die Fran�aise. The collection proves Mugler to be an utterly distinctive, yet endlessly inventive, talent. <i>--Alan Stewart</i></p>Context is the key in this collection of fashion photographs by French fashion designer Mugler. Setting his models against dramatic architectural backgrounds, he plays off texture against texture, color against color and the human in scale against the simply colossal. A spirit of self-referential humor infuses many of the color-saturated images as models mimic poses of huge statues, many of them political, or provide a provocative human focus in an imposing natural background. Mugler's contexts include the Algerian Sahara with vast reaches of patterned, shadowed sand, Arizona's Monument Valley, giant sunlit icefloes in Greenland and modern icons of architecture such as New York's Chrysler Building and ultra-modern facades in Paris and Moscow. As gathered here, the photographs are less revealing of modern fashion (not all the models wear Mugler designs) than they are of a particular cultural overview, making the foreword from France's Minister of Culture particularly fitting. Small black-and-white replications provide fashion information and identify settings. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Oral History: An Interdisciplinary Anthology (AASLH Book Series)</h2><p>This anthology explains the basics of oral history, and how to make use of it in research.

Wellum and Brent E. Parker have assembled a team of scholars who offer a fresh perspective regarding the interrelationship between the biblical covenants. Each chapter seeks to demonstrate how the covenants serve as the backbone to the grand narrative of Scripture.&nbsp;For example, New Testament scholar Thomas Schreiner writes on the Sabbath command from the Old Testament and thinks through its applications to new covenant believers. Christopher Cowan wrestles with the warning passages of Scripture, texts which are often viewed by covenant theologians as evidence for a "mixed" view of the church. Jason DeRouchie provides a biblical theology of &#x201c;seed&#x201d; and demonstrates that the covenantal view is incorrect in some of its conclusions. Jason Meyer thinks through the role of law in both the old and new covenants. John Meade unpacks circumcision in the OT and how it is applied in the NT, providing further warrant to reject covenant theology's link of circumcision with (infant) baptism. Oren Martin tackles the issue of Israel and land over against a dispensational reading, and Richard Lucas offers an exegetical analysis of Romans 9-11, arguing that it does not require a dispensational understanding.&nbsp;From issues of ecclesiology to the warning passages in Hebrews, this book carefully navigates a mediating path between the dominant theological systems of covenant theology and dispensationalism to offer the reader a better way to understand God&#x2019;s one plan of redemption.<br></p><p><b>Stephen J.

In 1979, she published the first encyclopedia of female divinities, a book that has remained in print since then in various formats and that she later expanded into the current volume.<br><b>Introduction</b><br><br> In 2008, archaeologists in Germany made a startling discovery. In Swabian Jura, where caves in limestone cliffs sheltered ancient humans, a figurine was unearthed from rubble. Carved from mammoth ivory, the figure showed a naked woman. Such figures have been found before where this Venus&#x201d; emerged, for the figure found in Hohle Fels Cave was named fora Roman goddess, as has been common since these figures were first discovered more than a century ago. In Austria (Willendorf and Galgenberg), France (Brassempouy, Laussel) and other European sites (Doln� V�stonice in the Czech Republic, Moravany in Slovakia, Monruz in Switzerland, Mal&#x2019;ta in Russia), archaeologists have found tiny figures of naked women. They are among the most ancient artworks of humanity, carved from stone or bone or molded from clay between twenty and thirty thousand years ago.<br><br> That long ago, during the Paleolithic Era, humans lived in small groups hunting and gathering foods. Recent studies suggest a large proportion, up to 80%, of their diet came from plant foods like berries, fruits and roots, which scholars assume were gathered by women. Meat, while providing necessary nutrients, was less readily available and required significant strength and skill to acquire, and it is presumed hunting was a predominantly male occupation, although women may have trapped small mammals and caught fish. What distinguishes this period of human history from earlier ones is, for the first time, humans began to use stone tools. This revolution led to others, such as the establishment of year-round villages and the invention of art.<br>What knowledge we have of these ancestors comes from scanty traces of their daily lives. Only material resistant to decay survives the millennia: bone, stone, fired clay. We have no way of knowing how ancient humans dressed or what footwear they favored. We have no Paleolithic fishing nets or traps, no spears, no baskets. We do not know how they organized their societies or traced their descent lines. We have no idea what languages they used. But, because they carved bone and painted on stone, we can see and appreciate their art. <br><br>The cave paintings at Lascaux and Pech-Merle in France show these ancient humans had a sophisticated sense of beauty and a command of painterly techniques. In Lascaux, animals leap and prance around the walls and roof of a series of interlocking caves. At Pech-Merle, spotted horses and wooly mammoths adorn the walls, and the outline of a hand suggests the presence of the artist. In addition to such painted galleries, we have dozens of examples of Paleolithic portable art in the form of expressive incised drawings of animals on bone and delicate carvings of Venus&#x201d; figurines.<br><br>Before 2008, experts dated these figures to between 28,000 and 24,000 years ago. Despite the span of time involved and despite the stylistic diversity in the figures, the Venuses share an emphasis on female sexual characteristics. Breasts and pubic triangle are always exaggerated; thighs and buttocks can be disproportionately large as well. This emphasis seems to have been so important that many Venuses have no facial features and only sketchy arms and legs. They are never clothed, although some wear what appear to be woven belts, and most have elaborate hairstyles. Contemporaneous cave paintings, with their highly realistic depiction of prey animals, show these artists did not lack pictoralability. Rather, the artists appear to have selectively exaggerated certain aspects of female anatomy.<br><br>Although we cannot know whether men or women (or both) made the carvings, or what they meant, interpretations abound. Among these is the idea the images represent the first known deity: a goddess. This theory is supported by the fact that virtually the only human images found in such ancient art are these full-bodied naked females, with the artists otherwise focusing their energies on animals. But this idea is a controversial one, especially among male scholars, some of whom prefer to label the figures as Paleolithic pornography,&#x201d; projecting today&#x2019;s sexual behavior into the distant past. Because for nearly 2,000 years, male monotheism has been the dominant religious pattern, the idea that ancient humans honored a goddess as their primary divinity is unsettling to many, scholars and non-scholars alike.<br><br><b>Mesoamerica</b><br><br> Mesoamerica&#x2019;s mythology has drawn little attention from scholars of women&#x2019;s spirituality. A possible reason is human sacrifice offered to goddesses as well as gods, a practice that runs counter to essentialist gender presumptions. This was not the predominant form of worship but was practiced in urban cultures. Elsewhere, decentralized cultures survived until modern times despite colonization, first by regional cultures, then by European invaders. Myths of interest to scholars of women&#x2019;s spirituality can be found in these cultures and among the Maya and Aztec. Mesoamerican religion presents multiplicity rather than uniformity throughout its development. <br> <br>The centralized and literate cultures of central Mexico are the best known. The Mayan, thrived for hundreds of years then declined, possibly because of drought. Much of what's known of Mayan religion derives from a document called the Popol Vuh, in which the Maya described the world as moving through various stages ( suns&#x201d;), each ending with a cataclysmic event, hence the Mayan attention to eclipses, comets and other celestial events over sometimes thousands of years.<br><br> In the 12th century CE, the Huaxtec were dominant in central Mexico. The names of a few of their goddesses remain, usually due to conflation with later divinities. Then came the Aztecs, who were flourishing when the Spanish arrived in the early 16th century. In 1299, the Aztecs had settled in Toltec territory but when, in 1323, the Aztecs sacrificed the Toltec king&#x2019;s daughter, the group was expelled. They drained swamps to create their city of Tenochtitlan. In 1426 the Aztec empire began, controlling much of Mexico for a century until Cort�s arrived. Two generations of war led to the control of the region by Spain.<br><br> Epidemics of diseases brought by the conquerors and previously unknown in Mesoamerica, killed as much as 50% of the population. Some survivors adapted to the new regime and left invaluable records. Christian missionaries recorded information about Aztec religion, although generally with the aim of destroying rather than preserving it.<br><br>Beyond the literate centralized societies, ethnographers and anthropologists have recorded myths from oral sources, which represent a fraction of what were rich traditions. Indigenous religious revivals have not been widespread in Central America, in part because some religious ways were absorbed into Catholic rituals and in part because of the extirpation of tribal people. North Americans&#x2019; interest in the region often focuses on shamanic aspects, an interest not entirely welcomed by native Central Americans. Revival of ritualized goddess religion has not been prominent, although feminists have recently worked to claim the image of Guadalupe as a symbol of indigenous feminine power.<br><b>Central American Pantheon</b><br><br>Chalchihuitlicue This jade skirted goddess ruled streams and rain. Lake waters were also under her command, for her people lived in flood areas. Chalchihuitlicue ruled salt water, controlling the sea and those who traveled on it. In her honor, the Aztecs called the Gulf of Mexico Chalchiuhcuey�cat, water of Chalchihuitlicue.&#x201d; <br><br>Chalchihuitlicue was depicted in jade necklace, turquoise earrings, a crown of iridescent blue feathers and a skirt trimmed with lilies. Her headdress featured large tassels that hung on each side of her face. She may have been honored at Teotihuac�n in the cave under the Pyramid of the Sun, where a statue of her was found. After Christianization, Chalchihuitlicue appeared as Do�a Mar�a Matlacoya, invoked in prayers for rain.<br><br><b>Chicomec�atl</b> Seven Serpent,&#x201d; an Aztec agricultural goddess who promoted human as well as vegetative reproduction, had many forms: a maiden decked with water flowers, a young woman whose embrace brought death, a mother carrying the sun as a shield. Chicomec�atl had several festivals. On April 5, homes were decorated with herbs sprinkled with blood. Everyone marched to the fields where they offered corn-sprouts decked with flowers and bundles of the previous year&#x2019;s harvest, with petitions for abundance. Every family offered a basket of food, topped with a cooked frog to remind the goddess of her need to work with Chalchihuitlicue to produce a good crop. <br>Another festival lasted from late June to mid-July, when wind pollinated corn. Women wore hair loose to encourage corn-silk to gather pollen. Corn pudding was eaten; people made merry. In the goddess&#x2019;s temple, a slave danced, adorned with face-paint. On the final night of the festival, the woman danced all night, meeting her death at daybreak when she was sacrificed. It was important her heart be beating when it was offered to Chicomec�atl with prayers for an abundant harvest. (Caso; Clendinnen; Dur�n; L�on-Portilla; Sahag�n I; Weigle.)<br><br><b>Cihuac�atl</b> The Aztec goddess of life&#x2019;s trials has been considered a form of Coatlicue. Her alternative names include Quauhciuatl ( eagle woman&#x201d;), Yoaciuatl ( warrior woman&#x201d;) and Tzitziminciuatl ( devil woman&#x201d;), perhaps each a separate aspect of the goddess.<br><br> Cihuac�atl wandered decked in jewels, moaning about coming disasters. In Tenochtitlan, she had a temple before which a perpetual fire burned. Within it, effigies of captured gods were imprisoned. She was depicted with an open mouth, eager for victims, wearing obsidian earplugs but otherwise dressed in white. More human sacrifices were offered to her than any other divinity.<br><br> In her pre-Aztec identity, she was a goddess of wilderness, but by Aztec times she was a divinity of war and sacrifice. She retained her identity as a goddess of creation, for she received the bones of the dead and ground them into paste from which she created humans. She was served by the Cihuateteo. (Brundage; Clendinnen; Dur�n; Josserand and Dakin; Sahag�n I; Weigle.)<br><b>Cihuateteo </b> Women who died in childbirth were envisioned by Aztecs as roaming the world weeping. They haunted crossroads, where they captured children. The Cihuateteo ( goddess women&#x201d;) were also called Ciuapipiltin ( honored women&#x201d;) because the deaths of women in childbirth equaled heroic deaths in war.<br> <br> The innumerable Cihuateteo lived in a western paradise called Cincalco, house of corn.&#x201d; When they appeared every 52 days, they stood out from living women by golden eyebrows and stark white complexions. Sometimes they were fearsome, with claws for hands and a skull instead of a head. Temples were erected at crossroads, and cakes offered to keep them from stealing children.<br><br> In contemporary folklore, she has been transformed into La Llorona, who carries a dead child through the streets. This weeping woman&#x201d; appears as a seducer of men who die violently, as a kidnapper of children or as a grieving mother. New Mexican legend claims she was never heard weeping until Cort�s invaded Mexico, after which she drowned her children and roamedmoonlit streets. She has been identified as Cort�s&#x2019;s interpreter, La Malinche, described as a traitor for collaborating with the invader and cursed to wander after death. (Barakat; Caso; Sahag�n I 19; Weigle; Weigle and White.)<br><b>China and Korea</b><br>The nearby kingdom of Korea kept its women&#x2019;s shamanic tradition alive into the present. Such shamans come from two traditions. Southern-tradition shamans derive their powers from matrilineally inherited access to spirits. Northern shamans are self-selected by spirit sickness" before being initiated by a practitioner. Located historically in territory that is now North Korea, this tradition is now predominant in Seoul, to which many northern shamans fled to escape Communist suppression.<br><br> Persecution of shamans is not new in Korea. Its strategic location between China and Japan led to invasion and occupation by both. When the Chinese brought Confucianism and later Buddhism, they tried to eliminate the native religion. Shamans survived marginally as healers, because no provision had been made to train doctors. But in 1409 CE, all shamanic books were burned; in 1472, the shamans were driven from Seoul. <br><br>The mudang survived, going underground until the end of colonial rulership. In the North, dictator Kim Il-sung made it his mission to end all religious practices save a token Buddhism. Shamanism in Communist Korea ended with the flight of mudang to Seoul, where they formed the basis of South Korean shamanism. The new Korean democracy did not welcome the refugee shamans.. But the Fifth Republic, dedicated under its 1980 constitution to preserving Korean cultural heritage, permits public announcement of rituals; dedicatory rituals led by mudang have opened several skyscrapers in Seoul. Yet like Native American tribal dances, these public performancesdo not mean the new government supports the old religion.<br><b>Alan Qo&#x2019;a </b> The ancestress of the Mongol hero ?Cinggis Khan was visited nightly by a yellow man who descended through the smoke-hole, rubbed his stomach, then turned into a yellow dog. This visitor fathered five sons. One day their mother gave them arrows to break. Although they could break single arrows, none could break five held together. Thus Alan Qo&#x2019;a showed her sons the necessity of cooperation. Another Mongol ancestral mother, Ala Nur, gave birth after encountering a lion.<br><br>Billkis The Uighur, a Chinese minority, tell of the princess Billkis, who began at the age of eight to embroider a veil for her wedding. It took eight years, so when Billkis turned sixteen, the veil was finished. She told her father the man who could understand her veil would become her husband, for he would able to read her inmost thoughts. One after another, princes came and looked at the veil, but all they saw was embroidered silk. They could not interpret Billkis&#x2019;s designs.<br><br> Finally, a raggedly young man discerned the veil&#x2019;s meaning. In the swirls of color, he saw a mountain, on which a witch stood guard over a green bird. His interpretation was correct, but Billkis wanted him to get the bird for her. Asking only for the pearl she wore in her right ear, he set off.<br><br> Finding the mountain, he climbed to the top, where he discovered the bird and the witch. Calling for the pearl to help him, he threw it into the air. There it glittered so strongly that the witch had to cover her eyes, allowing the hero to capture the bird and escape with it. This heroic action satisfied Billkis that the young man was her intended mate, but her father was horrified that she would not marry wealth. The king set impossible tasks for Billkis&#x2019;s beloved, saying he would cut off the lad&#x2019;s head if anything went awry. Instead, Billkis and her lover escaped on the bird and lived happily together. <br><br><b>Bixia Yuanjun</b> This mountain goddess, honored by women through the early part of the 20th century, represented untamed femininity, sometimes perceived as dangerous. Midwives and healers were devoted to her, as were young wives. Both rich and poor worshiped her, with as many as 47 festivals offered in her honor, most significantly her birthday, celebrated with a month of drumming and chanting. <br><br><b>Ch&#x2019;ang O</b> The Chinese moon goddess originally lived on earth, where her husband was the archer Yi. Yi killed her brother and shot an arrow into her hair to show her life was in his control. Because of his skill, the gods gave Yi the elixir of immortality, which Ch&#x2019;ang O found and drank.

Peggy Pascoe demonstrates how these laws were enacted and applied not just in the South but throughout most of the country, in the West, the North, and the Midwest. Beginning in the Reconstruction era, when the term miscegenation first was coined, she traces the creation of a racial hierarchy that bolstered white supremacy and banned the marriage of Whites to Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, and American Indians as well as the marriage of Whites to Blacks. She ends not simply with the landmark 1967 case of <em>Loving v. Virginia</em>, in which the Supreme Court finally struck down miscegenation laws throughout the country, but looks at the implications of ideas of colorblindness that replaced them. <em>What Comes Naturally</em> is both accessible to the general reader and informative to the specialist, a rare feat for an original work of history based on archival research.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peggy Pascoe</strong> is Beekman Professor of Northwest and Pacific History at the University of Oregon.<br><br>"Enormous breadth and depth...<em>What Comes Naturally</em> is a wonderfully written and copiously documented book that will appeal to both scholars and laypeople."--<em>The North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Highly original and important....The writing is admirably accessible, while the analyses and arguments are deeply nuanced....<em>What Comes Naturally</em> is an outstanding work of politically engaged research conducted by a creative and gifted scholar."--Mark Kessler, <em>Law and Politics Book Review</em><p></p><br>"This compelling history of the United States miscegenation law demonstrates its centrality to maintaining white supremacy in the century following the Civil War. Pascoe...weaves a fascinating story out of significant court cases, including McLaughlin v. Florida, an often overlooked 1964 case in which a co-habiting white woman and black man were successfully defended....Showing how marriage law can reinforce discrimination based on what is considered 'natural,' this timely argument also has relevance for the current debate over gay marriage."--<em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Pascoe's study of the race-making work of marriage prohibitions will be regarded as the definitive book on the history of miscegenation law in the United States for the foreseeable future. Her unprecedented attention to Western states' bans on intermarriage of whites with multiple categories of racial 'others' make this a newly comprehensive and remarkably revelatory treatment of a subject that scholars thought they knew."--Nancy F. Cott, author of <em>Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation</em><p></p><br>"A masterwork of erudition and consequence, <em>What Comes Naturally</em> reveals the hegemonic power of miscegenation through its naturalizing of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship and their claims to purity, property, morality, and legitimacy."--Gary Y. Okihiro, author of <em>Island World: A History of</em> <em>Hawai'i and the United States</em><p></p><br>"<em>What Comes Naturally</em> is a sweeping, provocative and compelling reexamination of the three-centuries of law concerning interracial marriage in the United States. Peggy Pascoe argues that property and power rather than the desire for racial purity propelled the creation of the body of legislation that stood at the center of racial discrimination against people of color. This book challenges much of what we know, or rather, much of what we think we know about race and marriage in America."--Quintard Taylor, University of Washington<p></p><br>"It would be hard to overestimate Pascoe's impact on the fields of U.S. History and American Studies. In this accessible, engagingly written and deeply nuanced picture of the economic, social, and ultimately political stakes in race thinking and miscegenation law, she brings together the individual stories, the different regions of the country, and the larger questions of nation-building and nation-formation. She exposes the eager, obsessive, and completely inconsistent categorizing of people into 'races.'"--Sarah Deutsch, Duke University<p></p><br>"Peggy Pascoe's book offers the distinctive pleasures of a large and fully imagined and beautifully researched work of history. <em>What Comes Naturally</em> explores the complexities and contradictions of a largely lost world--an almost inaccessible world for most people living in the America of the early 21st century--in which the power to use marriage laws to promote and to reinforce racial subordination was legitimate throughout much of the United States, even as couples across the country continued to insist on their right to marital freedom."--Hendrik Hartog, author of <em>Man and Wife in America, A</em> <em>History</em><p></p><br>"An uncannily timely history of laws against miscegenation...in the United States...[A] good book that recounts a fascinating history."--<em>The New Republic</em><p></p><br>"A comprehensive, accessible, and finely-crafted history of miscegenation law."--<em>Alexandra Street Press</em><p></p><br>"[Pascoe's] readable, meticulous, engaging, and comprehensive history of contingent and contested intercultural social constructions and interconnections of gender, race relations, personal identity, and the law should become a long-standing reference." --<em>Law and History Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Humanistic Psychotherapy: The Rational-Emotive Approach</h2><p>Dr. Ellis discusses the biological foundations of man&#39;s irrationality, the philosophical and cognitive errors that serve to reinforce and perpetuate neurotic behavior, and the manner in which rational-emotive psychotherapy copes with people prone to violence, paranoia, sexual difficulties, feelings of lack of self-worth and other difficulties.</p><p></p><h2>Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology, Third Edition,</i> </b>provides readers with a clear picture of the field of instructional design and technology, the trends and issues that have affected it in the past and present, and those trends and issues likely to affect it in the future.

Topics featured include engraving, etching, screenprinting and woodcuts.</p><p>An understanding of printmaking involves a familiarity with a wide variety of materials and processes. While entire volumes have been devoted to the in-depth study of many a particular process, Ayres has done an admirable job of distilling this imposing body of knowledge into a succinct and useful form. The author presents sufficient information to allow an aspiring printmaker to sort out the characteristics of different techniques and to begin working in one of the media. The illustrations, some of them the author's own work, are instructive and well presented.
